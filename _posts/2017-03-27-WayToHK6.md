### Senegal

#### Arrival

The flights from Casablanca to Dakar are a bit weird, with a 9PM - 1AM flight, and then
another even later 11PM - 3AM, so we ended up on the "earlier" one.  While in line, we
happened to run into someone who was working for the US Government in Dakar.  He gave us
some tips for what to do, and will sadly appear again soon... I'll call him Billy for the
rest of this post, as I suspect using real name would make him readilly identifiable.  The
flight itself was uneventful: Albert and I each napped a bit, and they served pretty-good
seafood on the flight which was nice.

Upon arrival, I walked over to customs and handed over my passport and was asked to put 
both my index fingers on a fingerprint-scanning device: everything was proceeding as normal.
Then, the agent asked me for my
[yellow vaccination card](XX).
Prior to traveling to Senegal, I had received the yellow fever vaccine on the advice of my
doctor. As far as we could tell from the internet, this card proving that vaccination was
only required for entry into Senegal from yellow-fever endemic countries. But I had gotten
the card anyway, thinking it would probably come in handy for future travel. I quickly
handed it over, and this is where things go South.  The agent said that my vaccination
record was missing typhoid and meningitis, without which I wouldn't be able to enter the
country. This was a "very big problem," and he threatened to mark my passport or something
such that I would be denied entry and sent backwards toward the planes. Of course, he then
said that I could make all my problems go away by paying a penalty fee. For the low low
price of $100 I could enter Senegal! This whole time, I'd been protesting that (1) I had
seen nothing to this effect in my pre-trip research and (2) I had no cash on me, whereupon
he asked me if I had a credit card. As far as I could tell, this was a simple attempt to
solicit bribes, which I guess he was also able to do via Square or something?

Anyway, at this point I decided to step back out of the line and wait for Albert and the
US government employee (Billy), though the agent refused to give my passport back.  Billy
told us that, across hundreds of arrivals into Senegal by him and his
friends/family/colleagues, nothing like this had ever happended. We tried to get the
attention of another airport employee mannig the customs line, but she only listened to
our story and then promptly walked away.  I don't blame her, if blatant bribe solicitation
like this is happening, an employee sticking their neck out to intervene is probably not
in their interest.  Billy mentioned at some point that Senegal is "so much better than
this," so perhaps I got unlucky here. I certainly had not read anything about Senegal
being highly corrupt or anything like that. It's in fact usually held up as an example of
stability in the region, the only country in West Africa that has
[never had a coup](XX).
But I was last in line from my bus cohort to go through customs, and probably looked
tired, young, and naive, ripe for harassment! Anyway, we all went to talk to the agent,
who claimed again that I was in the wrong, and that the information available on the
internet is highly out of date. Anyway, Billy had mentioned officer's captain's name as
well as his US government credentials, and the guard finally relented as let us pass into
the country "this time." To be clear, this means that Albert was stamped in without any
sort of international vaccination card at all, which is what we believed was the right
thing all along. In hindsight, I feel so lucky that we happened to stand in line behind
Billy while boarding, not sure what we would have done otherwise.

The whole experience was quite surreal, and the first time I've been ever had something like
this happen to me across all my travels (Senegal was my 40th country). 
This is despite traveling man places where I was warned it was rampant 
(e.g. [Transnistria](XX)).
I will end by saying that, it is possible that we were in the wrong here, but all my
research, pre- and post- travel, and Billy's experiences, point to this being a naked
attempt at extorting bribes.

Regardless, Albert then quickly retrieved his bag from baggage claim, and we headed
to our hotel, the Ibis Dakar, via their shuttle. The Ibis was, with its fancier
cousin the Novotel, part of a walled compound. The underside of our shuttle was
examined before we were allowed to enter. And then, in order to enter the hotel
itself, we had to put all our bags through a X-ray machine and walk through a metal
detector. Though to be honest, this seemed like the epitome of
[security theater](XX)
given that the single security guard helped us put our bags onto the belt, and then
immediately walked over to take them off...not stopping to you know, actually look at the
machine as our bags went by. I'm not exactly sure why this was necessary given Senegal's
general reputation for safety. I thought perhaps the hotel's foreign guests demanded this
level of security. But this experience was oft-repeated over the next couple of days, so
it seems to just be part of life in Dakar. I was wanded more in my 36 hours in Dakar than
any other time in my life. And often, it seemed clear that everything was just
for show. For example, upon entering the airport I had to put my bags through an X-ray
machine, but could keep my bulky sweatshirt with me, and was told specifically to walk
around the metal detector that was there.

After this rough welcome to Senegal, we grabbed a couple of hours of sleep, hopeful
that the next day would be better.

#### Exploring Dakar

We began the day at
[L'Ile Goree](XX),
a small island that's a short ferry ride away from DAkar. It was a historical place of
slave trading, though as I understand, its prominence is disputed by historians.  The
island itself was quite small, and we were basically able to walk around the whole thing
and see all the main sites in two hours or so. Highlights included the
[Maison Des Escleves](XX),
where you could see the rooms and shackles used to keep 
slaves. While on the island, we learned that Senegal somehow has a ridiculous
aversion to accepting large bills. Our repeated attempts to pay for 500 XX
admissions fees (1 USD ~ 610XX) with the 5000 bills from the ATM kept failing.
I'm not exactly sure why this was...perhaps they were sick of tourists coming
with large bills? But given that they were collecting loads of 500 and 1000
bills, they most definitely had the change they claimed not to...
We sadly just missed the ferry back, so we stopped for lunch on the island,
which was surprisingly good despite my apprehension given the touristy nature.
We had [yassa](XX)
which is a traditinoal local dish consisting of XXXX YYYY.

After returning to the mainland, we headed for the 
[Monument to the AFrican Renaissance](XX)
this huge statue of a man, woman, and child that's taller than the Statue of Liberty.
Billy had mentioned it the day before almost in passing, as something he'd never
been to. But, when he said that it'd been built by North Koreans, Albert and
I of course decided we had to go. It was built over
several years by the
[Mansudae Construction company](XX).
Mansudae, by the way, is also the name
of the [famous monument](XX) with the towering statues of the Kims in North Korea.
It weirdly seemed to not be very popular with tourists that day, as we quickly
felt extremely out of place. The base of the monument was absolutely filled
with school groups of varying ages. And as children do, they kept staring
and pointing at us.
After some confusion, we were able to enter and take the elevator up to the top,
which is in the head of the man. From there, you get a great vantage point over
Dakar, and can also see the other parts of the statue. Here's the woman looking up
at us:

![](XX)

We then walked through the various exhibits that were on the couple floors inside
the base of the statue. Martin Luther King and Barack Obama were prominently 
featured right next to portraits of the nation's four presidents. As our guide told us,
Barack Obama was the realization of MLK's dream:

![](XX)

As we continued to walk around, it struck me how prominent the African diaspora,
and in particular African Americans, were. Another floor had sculptures and
portraits of famous Africans, which included people like
[Mana Munsa](XX)and [Nefertiti](XX),
but also James Brown, Stevie Wonder, and Marcus Garvey. Here's a who's who of the
American Civil Rights movement:

![](XX)

STOP HERE

Perhaps this isn't surprising
to others, but I must confess I'm generally not too informed about contemporary Africa.
There was also quite a bit of space devoted to the monument being both Pan-African 
and hopeful. The woman's hand points backward toward L'Ile Goiree, but is being
lifted by the hardworking African man, with the baby pointing/looking optimistically
into the bright future (this is a paraphrase of our guide's remarks). There was also
a big deal made about how many different African countries had sent dignitaries to attend
the unveiling, and/or had prominently displayed pieces of artwork. For example, this throne
is apparently from Angola:

![](XX)

Finally, there was this temporary about Gandhi on the first floor, which semeed a bit
odd to us. We had befriended an American couple while inside, with the wife being an 
African-American studies professor. She mentioned that Gandhi had been fiercely
racist against African people...so it was even weirder... She had also received her
doctorate at Northwestern where Albert goes now, small world!

From the monument, we walked west toward the Western tip of Dakar. This is where a lot
of foreign activites are located, and expats live. For example, we walked by several
UN efforts and also saw the US embassy. Unsurprisingly, it's also home to several
fancy hotels. We were heading this way in order find the Westernmost point on mainland
Africa, Le Pointe des Almadies. But first, we stopped the simply named "American Food Store."
It was everything an expat might need, from Heinz ketchup to Pampers diapers to Easy Mac.
But my hands-down favorite was the display of Solo cups:

![](XX)

The prices were actually quite reasonable, perhaps even a bit cheaper than the US after
conversion. 

-Got lost on the hotel of Mohammed V...conference attendees in suits, confused tourists
wearing shorts..somehow no one gave us weird looks. Then, onto their gold course,
where we continued to stumble around looking for this point. It didn't help that 
we didn't exactly know what we were looking for. We finally ended up finding it by
basically walking behind a random building and around a bunch of rocks piled
up on the coast. Doing this in boat shoes after walking 10 miles that day was...non-ideal.
But thankfully no one was hurt, and we made it!

We ended our day by going to Le Lagon, apparently the fanciest restaurant in all of Senegal.
Another reason to visit off-the-beaten track countries, you can eat the best restaurant
in town for basically the same price as a New York City Applebee's.

Overall Senegal Thoughts:
Despite the terrible experience at customs, and the general unease resulting from the 
crazy security everywhere, I had a great time in Senegal.

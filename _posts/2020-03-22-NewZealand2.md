### Day 1: Arrival to the Land of the Hobbits

I arrived in Auckland Sunday morning, after leaving NYC Friday afternoon. This was the unfortunate consequence of 20 hours of flying,
a three-hour layover in LAX, and NZ being 18 hours ahead of NYC at the time. Thankfully, I slept surprisingly well on the plane, and got through
customs with unexpected ease. Given its relative isolation from the world, New Zealand is particularly strict about
biosecurity. You're basically not allowed to bring any food or other organic matter into the country.
As an example of the stringency,
I think they often ask travelers to rinse off used hiking boots to remove caked-on dirt/mud.
There's even an somewhat entertaining television show about this: _Nothing to Declare_ (many episodes available on
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=nothing+to+declare+nz)).
But even though I ticked the box for vitamins/medicine, I went basically straight through.
Interestingly, there was a large Chinese-only sign about the regulations:

and also one in Thai. After exiting the airport, I quickly found Michal (who'd arrived the previous morning from HKG) and we were
off in my 58th country!

#### Hobbiton

We began our New Zealand adventure at the [Hobbiton Movie Set](https://www.hobbitontours.com/), where you can tour some of the exterior
sets used in the filming of _The Lord of the Rings_ and _The Hobbit_ trilogies. I wasn't too enthused about this in the first place,
but by the time I did any research and realized it was going to be super touristy, Michal had already booked it. It basically
met expectations in my opinion. It was cool to see the little hobbit holes and hear interesting stories about the history of the set.
But you have to weigh that against all the tourist
trap vibes: you sign up for a particular departure time, ride on a bus with a tour guide telling corny jokes, stick
together as a group lest you run into one of the many other groups exploring the same area, etc. Maybe the problem is that I'm not a die-hard
LotR fan? Overall, this was my least favorite of the things we did in NZ, which must mean that the blog will only get better from
here, right? At the end of the tour (before you head back to the parking lot on the tour bus, that is), they do give you a glass of beer/cider at the ["Green Dragon"](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Dragon_Inn) which was a nice touch. Anyway, here I am with one of the small hobbit holes:

They have several different versions of some of them in different sizes, used to compose shots such that e.g. Frodo looks small
and Gandalf looks large. Note that you can't enter most of these, and even the ones you can are basically empty on the inside, as the
interior scenes were shot elsewhere.

As an aside, there's an interesting political history
to these movies, in that the New Zealand government passed ["The Hobbit Law"](https://www.fodors.com/world/australia-and-the-pacific/new-zealand/experiences/news/heres-how-new-zealands-hobbit-law-is-impacting-the-country)
which made filming in New Zealand more studio/business-friendly.

#### The End of the Rainbow

From here, we headed further south toward
[Waitomo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waitomo), to position ourselves to visit the famous
[Waitomo Glowworm Caves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waitomo_Glowworm_Caves) the following day.
We drove a little out of our way to stop at the [Marakopa Falls](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/waikato/places/waitomo-area/tracks/marokopa-falls-walk/), which turned out to be unexpectedly delightful.
Provided you're happy to ignore a danger warning sign,
you can walk down pretty close to the base of them by scrambling around a bit (basically past
where Michal is standing here on photographer's left/his right):

which that day literally took me to the end of the rainbow!

Sadly I didn't find a pot of gold or a leprauchaun. It was nice to be out and about in the sun though, as I was otherwise starting to crash due to the
time difference. We ate dinner at [Huhu Cafe](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g616349-d1161019-Reviews-Huhu_Cafe-Waitomo_Caves_Waitomo_District_Waikato_Region_North_Island.html) which was quite good, before
finally arriving at our accomodation for the evening.

#### Staying in a Hobbit-hole!

We stayed that night at [Woodlyn Park](http://www.woodlynpark.co.nz/), which is almost certainly the coolest
accomodation provider I've ever stayed with. You can stay in many rooms in an old boat (the "Waitanic"):

or basically in the cockpit of an old [Bristol Freighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Freighter):

in an old train car:

or in our case, a hobbit hole!

Sadly the interior is somewhat bland, but the round door and window openings were really quite charming.
You're definitely paying for the novelty instead of the quality of the accommodation itself, but I think
it's well worth the money. It would have been fun to stick around for another day and explore one
of the other rooms, but unfortunately there wasn't room in our travel schedule.

### Day 2: Waitomo Glowworms!

Still jetlagged, I woke up in time to see the sunrise and wander around the property, hearing only the crunch of gravel
beneath my feet and the crowing of roosters in the background.
It'd been a long time since I'd seen the sunrise&mdash;this vacation was off to a nice and peaceful start.

The main event of the day was the Glowworm Caves (more on that later), but we had some time in the morning so we also
drove to the [Mangapohue Natural Bridge](https://www.waitomo.com/discover/nature/mangapohue-natural-bridge). It's the last
remnant of a old cave system, which now appears as a bridge because everything else has collapsed around it. It was a
good way to kill an hour or so in the morning, but I think probably not worth going out of your way to see. Somehow I didn't
take any photos of it, please see [here](https://www.theoutbound.com/new-zealand/photography/explore-the-mangapohue-natural-bridge)
for some good ones.

#### Waitomo Glowworms Black Abyss

The main event of the day, and the whole reason we were in Waitomo, was to see the [Glowworm Caves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waitomo_Glowworm_Caves).
There are a number of possible tour providers in the area, which I gathered each take visitors to separate caves via agreements with local
farmers.
We did the ["Black Abyss"](https://www.waitomo.com/black-water-rafting/legendary-black-water-rafting-co-black-abyss) from the
[The Legendary Black Water Rafting Co.](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g616349-d258550-Reviews-The_Legendary_Black_Water_Rafting_Co-Waitomo_Caves_Waitomo_District_Waikato_Region.html), advertised
as the "maximum-adrenaline Black Water Rafting tour." I was a bit apprehensive based on this description, as I'm not exactly
an adrenaline junkie. But it seemed like the coolest of all of the options, and I'm glad we did it. If you look around, there are definitely
more relaxed tours that aren't as physically demanding; some even let you see the glowworms without getting wet. But if you have the time
and are up for it,
I'd really recommend this one. Michal and I both agreed it was one of our favorites parts of the trip.
I'll describe the tour in more detail below, but consider skipping this section if you think you want to preserve
the mystique.
(I genuinely do think the tour is more fun if you don't know what's coming next).

We began by suiting up with wet suits, helmets, and abseiling gear. Here's the group ready to begin:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/K-xwixZASRzGZuA9P5RXzWg7bqe6no2FM9VyPz6RsH60XPyLNH9QnJE50N64i6zkilDVQcPzfSBICQKkt4lA9MbF48_2lyAd9rnODngTfqNNZThvG4H6Q0HK-nFBesx3DPcsHrYLW18=w2400)

The max group size is eight (we were seven that day), with two guides accompanying us. There were in fact three
people from Hong Kong with us, and we chatted briefly about the COVID situation and whether they were concerned. Little
did we know...

We began by abseiling a hundred feet down into the cave:

I feel like I get a little more afraid of heights every year, so I didn't love this part. At the bottom, one of our guides then sent
us down a zipline in the dark, which was great fun. And from
here, it was into the water we went!

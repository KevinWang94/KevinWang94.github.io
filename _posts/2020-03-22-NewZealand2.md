### Day 1: Arrival to the Land of the Hobbits

I arrived in Auckland Sunday morning, after leaving NYC Friday afternoon. This was the unfortunate consequence of 20 hours of flying,
a three-hour layover in LAX, and NZ being 18 hours ahead of NYC at the time. Thankfully, I slept surprisingly well on the plane, and got through
customs with unexpected ease. Given its relative isolation from the world, New Zealand is particularly strict about
biosecurity. You're basically not allowed to bring any food into the country, and as an example of the stringency,
I think they often ask travelers to rinse off used hiking boots to remove caked-on dirt/mud. 
There's even an somewhat entertaining television show about this: _Nothing to Declare_ (many episodes available on
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=nothing+to+declare+nz)).
But even though I ticked the box for vitamins/medicine, I went basically straight through.
Interestingly, there was a large Chinese-only sign about the regulations:

and also one in Thai. After exiting the airport, I quickly found Michal (who'd arrived the previous morning from HKG) and we were
off in my 58th country! 

#### Hobbiton

We began our New Zealand adventure at the [Hobbiton Movie Set](https://www.hobbitontours.com/), where you can tour some of the exterior
sets used in the filming of _The Lord of the Rings_ and _The Hobbit_ trilogies. I wasn't too enthused about this in the first place,
but by the time I did any research and realized it was going to be super touristy, Michal had already booked it. It basically
met expectations in my opinion. It was cool to see the little hobbit holes and hear interesting stories about the history of the set.
But you have to weigh that against all the tourist
trap vibes: you have to sign up for a particular departure time, ride on a bus with a tour guide telling corny jokes, stick
together as a group lest you run into one of the many other groups exploring the same area, etc. Maybe the problem is that I'm not a die-hard
LotR fan? Overall, I think this was my least favorite of the things we did in NZ, which must mean that the blog will only get better from
here, right? At the end of the tour (before you head back to the parking lot on the tour bus, that is), they do give you a glass of beer/cider at the ["Green Dragon"](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Dragon_Inn) which was a nice touch. Anyway, here I am with one of the small hobbit holes:

They have several different versions of some of them in different sizes, used to compose shots such that e.g. Frodo looks small
and Gandalf looks large. Note that you can't enter most of these, and even the ones you can are basically empty on the inside, as the
interior scenes were shot elsewhere. 

As an aside, there's an interesting political history
to these movies, in that the New Zealand government passed ["The Hobbit Law"](https://www.fodors.com/world/australia-and-the-pacific/new-zealand/experiences/news/heres-how-new-zealands-hobbit-law-is-impacting-the-country)
which made filming in New Zealand more studio/business-friendly.

#### The End of the Rainbow

From here, we headed further south toward 
[Waitomo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waitomo), to position ourselves to visit the famous
[Waitomo Glowworm Caves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waitomo_Glowworm_Caves) the following day.
We drove a little out of our way to stop at the [Marakopa Falls](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/waikato/places/waitomo-area/tracks/marokopa-falls-walk/), which turned out to be unexpectedly delightful.
You can walk down pretty close to the base of them by scrambling around a bit (basically past
where Michal is standing here on the left):

which that day literally took me to the end of the rainbow:

Sadly I didn't find a pot of gold or a leprauchan. It was nice to be out and about in the sun though, as I was otherwise starting to crash due to the
time difference. We ate dinner at [Huhu Cafe](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g616349-d1161019-Reviews-Huhu_Cafe-Waitomo_Caves_Waitomo_District_Waikato_Region_North_Island.html) which was quite good, before
finally arriving at our accomodation for the evening.

#### Staying in a Hobbit-hole!

We stayed that night at [Woodlyn Park](http://www.woodlynpark.co.nz/), which is probably the coolest
accomodation provider I've ever stayed with. You can stay in many rooms in an old boat (the "Waitanic"):

or basically in the cockpit of an old [Bristol Freighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Freighter):

in an old train car:

or in our case, a hobbit hole!

Sadly the interior is somewhat bland, but the round door and window openings were really quite charming.
You're definitely paying for the novelty instead of the quality of the accommodation itself, but I think
it's well worth the money. It would have been fun to stick around for another day and explore one
of the other rooms, but unfortunately there wasn't room in our travel schedule.

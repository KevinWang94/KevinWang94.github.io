###Day 9: The End

We began the day at the Blue Lagoon, a sorely needed bit of relaxation after
a stressful week. Though probably overpriced and the quintessential Icelandic tourist spot,
it was still wonderful to be there in the (unfortunately artificial) hot spring. The constrast between
the warm water and the frigid air (it actually started snowing) was stark, and
made exiting the water each time absolutely horrid. Highlights included a super-cool steam cave, as
well as exfoliating silica mud - my skin was in tiptop shape for our return to America!

Next came the scary part: returning our rental car. We filled out the necessary paperwork, and
put 2079 euros on Aaron's credit card...an expense that would've doubled the total cost of our
vacation. Thankfully, in the end VISA really pulled through and completely covered the cost due to
their rental car protections, even including the foreign transaction fee. For anyone reading this,
definitely take advantage of VISA's rental car benefits!

At the airport, our jar of peanut butter was sadly confiscated, a devastating loss given our
sentimental attachment. So of course, we chose to drown our sorrows, and celebrate our survival, with
a glass of wine. And after an uneventful flight, we did indeed make it back to Boston alive!

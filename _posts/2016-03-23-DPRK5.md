### Day 4: The Last

This was our last real day in Korea, and involved a lot of smaller sights within
Pyongyang.

#### Pyongyang Metro

We began the day with a ride on the Pyongyang Metro, stopping off at three of the
more beautiful stations (though to be clear the ones we went by didn't seem terribly
run down). The stations were pretty cavernous feeling compared to Boston or NYC, with
beautiful murals on either side of the leaders and/or revolutionary struggles:

I even got this photo with an adorable child riding the subway with us:

All of us on the tour were surprised at how uncontrolled this part seemed to be,
as we shared crowded subway cars with local Koreans. Of course, this is not to say
that this wasn't being orchestrated behind our backs in some way...perhaps that
child was a bit too cute...

#### Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum

This was another heavily propagandized locations. First, we went to check out
the many captured arms and vehicles from the Korean War. It seems that they've
saved basically every captured tank or shot-down plan. Next came the
USS Pueblo, the only currently commissioned US ship in enemy captivity. Both
around the boat and on it, a big deal was made about the ship's wrongdoing
and the shipmen's confessions.

Then came the museum building itself, where we walked through exhibitions
such as "US Atrocities During the Korean War" and watched a video which
highlighted the incessant instigation of conflict by the US imperialists
under the guise of liberation. In particular, the US ruthlessly tamped down
democratic activities in South Korea to prop up the puppet regime. And it also
fought the Korean War to distract its citizens from a serious economic crisis
which swept the nation in 1948. Even though I'd been hearing bits and pieces
of this narrative all week, this video was still a lot to take in. And others
on the tour felt similarly. I was surprised at just how blatantly anti-American
the entire video and tour were, given that our party was entirely Western
and included several Americans other than me and Aaron. More thoughts
about this in a later post. 

Sadly we weren't allowed to take pictures within the museum, but I did manage
to get this photo with our tour guide:

#### Kim Il Sung Birthplace

Next up was a national monument to Kim Il Sung's birthplace, where you can see the
building that he grew up in. It's apparently so sacred that we were unable to step
on the ground of the building itself or even the steps leading up to it!
Not sure how much of what we were told was actually true, but it seemed very
engineered to make his upbringings seem as humble as possible.

#### Pyongyang Landmarks

Next in the day were several landmarks in Pyongyang.
[Kim Il Sung Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il-sung_Square)
is the large central square of Pyongyang that serves as the location for
many rallies and marches in the country. In fact, throughout the square
there is a careful numbered grid of dots used for the soldiers. Our guide,
Mr. Pang, even instructed us about how to march properly, as he had been in
the military and marched through the very square. Here's me applying those
lessons!

While in the square, our bus was also parked next to a bus of Koreans, whom
Aaron was able to get a lot of waves from by waving a North Korean flag
that he had purchased. Then, Albert remembered that he had purchased a
large Korean flag which, the unfurling of which got applause from the Koreans!

The [Juche Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche_Tower) was built for
Kim Il Sung's 70th birthday, and named after his Juche ideology. We were given
the option to take the elevator up, but it didn't seem worth the money for
a view similar to the hotel. While waiting in the tower, we were able to find
an issue of the Pyongyang Times which included an article about Otto Warmbier
though. Pardon my weird facial expression:

Finally, we checked out the
[Monument to the Party Founding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_to_Party_Founding).
It includes the symbols of their party: a hammer, sickle, and writing brush.
The last modification to the normal communist symbols represents the intellectual
and studious nature of the party. Here's Aaron, Albert, and me in front of the
monument:

#### Bowling, Dinner, and Diplomat's Club

The rest of the night was much more carefree. We stopped to bowl at the
Pyongyang Gold Lane before a hotpot dinner and then the Diplomat's Club.

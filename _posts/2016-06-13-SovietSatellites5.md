### Intro



### Dushanbe

We arrived in Dushanbe Airport just after lunchtime, and passed through a
surprisingly relaxed passport control before meeting our guides for the day,
Parvina and Faridun. XX Things about guides.

We then walked around the downtown area for a bit, seeing first a statue of
their national hero,
[Isma'il Somoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isma%27il_ibn_Ahmad).
He's really everywhere in Tajikistan, with the national currency named after
him as well as parks, roads, and statues everywhere. We heard repeatedly over
the next couple of days about how so-and-so road/park/mountain was previously
named after Stalin/Lenin/Communism but has since been renamed in Somoni's honor.
Next was a
[flagpole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushanbe_Flagpole),
formerly the tallest
in the world (it has since been surpassed by one in Saudi Arabia). The thing
really is massive, being nearly as tall as the Washington Monument, as flying
a flag that weights *1540 pounds*.

Up next were the National Museum of Antiquities, where we were given a tour
by a local guide about the various relics left behind by the waves of
peoples and religions that had inhabited this region. 

The large museum reminded me in many ways of North Korea. First, it seemed
largely empty until we arrived, with the escalators only turned on after
we walked through one exhibit. More importantly, there were several displays
regarding their (at this point basically Eternal) President
[Emomali Rahmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emomali_Rahmon). Here's
a map of all his trips around the world:

And a room dedicated to gifts given to him by world leaders:

We had seen identical (albeit flashier) displays in the DPRK. There was even
a display of his various works, all of which were read by our museum guide
while in university. 
### Khujand

We ended our day at Hissar Fortress.

### Drive to Khujand

The next day, we set out with Feridun for Tajikistan's second largest city,
[Khujand](XX)
which is located in the North.

Along the way, we drove through several newly built tunnels, which
unsurprisingly greatly shortened the driving distance. They were also a great
example of foreign industry, as all of them seemed to have been dug by either
Chinese or Iranian companies. 

Around lunchtime, we stopped at Iskandor-Kol, this nice alpine lake. The real
highlight though, was this waterfall we trekked out to. There was a perfect
rainbow in the spray:

us it was safe. After all, it was constructed in Soviet times! The placement
of heavy rocks here was not reassuring...


Interesting

Interesting things said by guides:

-Parvina:



Khujand Guide:
-People wonder how the President came to power, perhaps supported by Uzbekistan, perhaps
by a lieutenant of Yeltsin. No one really knows.
-Uzbekistan is the only country in Central Asia that has policies independent from Russia.
-President of Uzbekistan looks down on Putin, was already a President while Putin was
still in the tunnels of the Kremlin.
-Sunni vs. Shi'a.

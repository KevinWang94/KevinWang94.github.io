### Intro

From Almaty, we flew to Tajikistan, described by our guidebook as
"arguably Central Asia's most exciting destination." We certainly
had a great time!

### Dushanbe

We arrived in Dushanbe Airport just after lunchtime, and passed through a
surprisingly relaxed passport control before meeting our guides for the day,
Parvina and Faridun. In addition to guiding, they both worked as teachers of
English and Chemistry, respectively. Parvina was especially interesting in that
she called attention to herself being a "modern Muslim woman," having gone to
college and also been divorced, both incredibly rare in this traditional
country in which many marriages are still arranged.

After making peace with the heat, we walked around the downtown area
for a bit, seeing first a statue of their national hero,
[Isma'il Somoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isma%27il_ibn_Ahmad).
He's really everywhere in Tajikistan, with the national currency named after
him as well as parks, roads, and statues everywhere. We heard repeatedly over
the next couple of days about how so-and-so road/park/mountain was previously
named after Stalin/Lenin/Communism but has since been renamed in Somoni's honor.
Next was a
[flagpole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushanbe_Flagpole),
formerly the tallest
in the world (it has since been surpassed by one in Saudi Arabia). The thing
really is massive, being nearly as tall as the Washington Monument. It flies
a flag that weights *1540 pounds*.

We then went to the National Museum of Antiquities, where we were given a tour
by a local guide about the various relics left behind by the waves of
peoples and religions that had inhabited this region. The highlight was
the "Nirvana Buddha," an 45 foot Buddha lying on its side found recently
in Tajikistan. After came the National Museum, an airy new building that
contained exhibits regarding history, art, geology, and nature. 

This museum reminded me in many ways of North Korea. First, it seemed
largely empty until we arrived, with the escalators only turned on after
we walked through one exhibit. Moreover, there were several displays
regarding their (at this point basically Eternal) President
[Emomali Rahmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emomali_Rahmon). For example,
here's a map of all his trips around the world:

There was also a luxuriously decorated room dedicated to gifts given to
him by world leaders. We had seen basically identical (albeit flashier)
displays in the DPRK about the Kims. There was even
a display of Rahmon's various works, all of which were apparently read by
our museum guide while in university:

Next was Hissar fortress, located a short drive away from the city.
This was frankly underwhelming, as the visible buildings are largely
new reproductions. In addition, there was a small museum, where 
a very enthusiastic guide told us how Tajikistan is 93\% mountains (probably the
fourth time I'd heard this today) and showed us more stone age tools.
I was...not particularly enthused by this presentation.

That evening, I wasn't feeling well, so our guides ordered room service for me,
while Aaron went to dinner and wandered around the city for a bit, saying
goodbye to Parvina for the both of us as she was just our guide for Dushanbe.
We both wished we had had more time to talk to her about modern day Tajikistan,
perhaps next time?

### Onwards to Khujand

The next day, we set out with Faridun for Tajikistan's second largest city,
[Khujand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khujand)
which is located in the North.
Along the way, we drove through several newly built tunnels, which
unsurprisingly greatly shortened the driving distance. They were also a great
example of foreign industry, as all of them seemed to have been dug by either
Chinese or Iranian companies. 

Around lunchtime, we stopped at [Iskandor-Kol](XX),
this nice alpine lake. The real
highlight though, was this waterfall we trekked out to. There was a perfect
rainbow in the spray:

Picture taken from this pretty sketchy looking platform. Faridun assured
us it was safe. After all, it was constructed in Soviet times! The placement
of heavy rocks here was not reassuring...nor were the rather widely
spaced and bent bars:

From here, we drove to
[Istaravshan](XX),
an old city sacked by Alexander the Great
back in the day. There are only remnants of the original old fortress, but a new
gleaming gate was built in 2002 for the city's 2500th anniversary. Again,
I didn't find this particular interesting as there was not much to see
aside from the recent constructions.

Finally, it was onwards to Khujand. It's thought to be near the Alexander
the Great's northernmost Central Asia outpost.
In Soviet times, the city was named
Leninabad, the main street of which was Lenin, on which was this huge
statue of Lenin:

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/js3i99v0rh37aoc/P6110080.JPG?dl=0)

It's since been moved to a more out of the way location (replaced with a statue
of Somoni of course). Our guide told us that it is the largest still standing
statue of Lenin in the former Socialist Republics.

At dinner, Faridun insisted we try some local alcohol. Unfortunately, the
restaurant wasn't serving it on account of Ramadan, so he just ran to a local
shop and bought some vodka. It was surprisingly smooth. My attempts to
adulterate it with watermelon were less successful.

We finished up sight-seeing in Khujand the next morning, first meeting our
guide in the city, Shahboz. The highlight of the day was the beautiful Bazaar:

Driving around the city, I finally snapped a picture of one of the many
Rahmon posters that are all around Tajikistan. He wasn't quite as ubiquitous
as the Kims in the DPRK, but pretty darn close. For example, our hotel in
Khujand displayed photos of him at its opening.

Over lunch, we had a nice chat with Boz. He shared some interesting thoughts
about everything from regional politics to the Sunni - Shi'a split.
Nearly all of Central Asia is Sunni, but apparently conversions to Shi'ismXX
brought about by Iran do occur, and tensions may be mounting. He also told
several horror stories about people being detained while exiting or entering
Uzbekistan. A couple of hours before we were supposed to cross the land border
by ourselves, this was not particular reassuring...

After lunch we bid farewell to our guides. I don't often travel with guides,
but my experience in Tajikistan showed me how much of a difference they can
make. Of the three countires so far, Aaron and I efinitely liked Tajikistan
the most, and I think that is in large part to the interesting conversations
we had with our local guides. I would not hesitate to recommend
[Faridun](XX), Parvina, or [Shahboz](XX) for anyone journeying to Tajikistan.
Here's a picture of us with Faridun and Shahboz
on the last day, unfortunately we missed getting a picture with Parvina:

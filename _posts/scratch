Mr. Kim told some jokes!

A variant on [this joke](http://www.aish.com/j/j/112998949.html)
with three characters, from America, China, and Korea. The story is that the American
grabs a parachute and jumps, proclaiming America to be the greatest nation on the Earth.
This leaves the Chinese and Korean people left, who both offer the parachute to one another
on account of their friendship. But then, they realize that all is good, as the American
jumped off the plane with a backpack!

Military service, no longer mandatory? Mr. Kim said that he did not serve.
Mr. Pang said he did. I heard from others that Mr. Kim's father was a diplomat, so
perhaps he pulled strings to get him out.


National Origin:

Mr. Pang, Wang made me Korean? (Not true).

Meet tour guides! Talk with Mr. Kim about Otto Warmbier. Let's be respectful of
local customs and make good memories. Every country has good people and bad people.

First impressions of Pyongyang: doesn't look that different from China...
Taxis, lots of foreign vehicles. 
Arch of Triumph - is it the biggest one? 
Reunification gate thing

Paintings of the leaders are everywhere

Yanggakdo Hotel - lots of services. Truly on an isolated island. 

Dinner strangely has Western food! 

### Day 2

DMZ

Tour from a military soldier. Various photos in the buildings. 
If the US provokes another Korean war, we will smash them. Our country is the most powerful state.

US provoked the Korean war, suffered losses, suggested peace talks. 

US hide the shame of defeat, used the UN flag. Ran away at the end without the flag. This is evidence
of their defeat in the Korean War and the aggressive nature of the US.

Lunch at a place with a lot of bowls. Dog soup, dog penis...

Vile snake liquor...

Duck BBQ restaurant

Dinner place with dancing...


Division of Korea

Throughout our trip, the guides spoke at length about the painful division of
Korea and the suffering of the Korean people. Even though it likely means the end
of the regime, reunification was loudly proclaimed in both rhetoric and physical
monuments. All people want peace.

Perceptions of the United States

Perceptions of their Leaders

All the Korean people respect their leaders honestly. The guides were self-aware,
mentioning that. People are very sensitive because of the.

### Overall Profound Thoughts?

### Time in Beijing
Extremely hot hotpot
National Performing Arts Center 

### Day 1

Can't believe this is really happening! 
Flight: good beer, famous female band, crazy infamous Chicken sandwich 

Clearing security: one dicey moment, but in general much less strict than expected. 
Didn't log into chromebook. 

Meet tour guides! Talk with Mr. Kim about Otto Warmbier. Let's be respectful of
local customs and make good memories. Every country has good people and bad people.

First impressions of Pyongyang: doesn't look that different from China...
Taxis, lots of foreign vehicles. 
Arch of Triumph - is it the biggest one? 
Reunification gate thing

Paintings of the leaders are everywhere

Yanggakdo Hotel - lots of services. Truly on an isolated island. 

Dinner strangely has Western food! 

### Day 2

DMZ

Tour from a military soldier. Various photos in the buildings. 
If the US provokes another Korean war, we will smash them. Our country is the most powerful state.

US provoked the Korean war, suffered losses, suggested peace talks. 

US hide the shame of defeat, used the UN flag. Ran away at the end without the flag. This is evidence
of their defeat in the Korean War and the aggressive nature of the US.

Lunch at a place with a lot of bowls. Dog soup, dog penis...

Vile snake liquor...

Sariwon City

Duck BBQ restaurant

Talk with Ms. Kim about puppet army

Perceptions of their Leaders

All the Korean people respect their leaders honestly. The guides were self-aware,
mentioning that. People are very sensitive because of the.

Kim Il-Sung

He is definitely the most glorified. In the national narrative, he liberated Korea from the
"miserable life under Japanese colonialism" (this is true I believe).

His birthdate, 4/15/1912 is one that I'm likely to remember for the rest of my life given how
often we were told about it while in the country.

The Eternal President

Kim Jong-Il 
5-6 years of difficulties, experienced shortages of food, lacking of electricity and fuel for factories.
But still, Kim Jong-Il defended and led the revolution.


Mr. Kim told some jokes!

A variant on [this joke](http://www.aish.com/j/j/112998949.html)
with three characters, from America, China, and Korea. The story is that the American
grabs a parachute and jumps, proclaiming America to be the greatest nation on the Earth.
This leaves the Chinese and Korean people left, who both offer the parachute to one another
on account of their friendship. But then, they realize that all is good, as the American
jumped off the plane with a backpack!

Military service, no longer mandatory? Mr. Kim said that he did not serve.
Mr. Pang said he did. I heard from others that Mr. Kim's father was a diplomat, so
perhaps he pulled strings to get him out.

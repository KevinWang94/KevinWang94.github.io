This begins a series of blog posts about my spring break 2016 trip to the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea with Aaron Roper (stopping for a couple days in Beijing en route). I'm writing
this first post from Beijing before leaving for Pyongyang, but all the later ones will be 
retroactive as we won't have internet access while in the DPRK. 

### Introduction

After Iceland and the Balkans, we obviously had to up the craziness for third and final
installment of our spring break travel, so we of course settled on North Korea! 
I realize this choice is...unorthodox so thie first post is dedicated mostly to explaining 
myself. 

### Why North Korea

First, please see my previous post about traveling philosophy for a general sense of why 
I go to countries that are off the beaten path. 

Specific to this trip, the DPRK is just an incredibly fascinating place for many reasons. 
The last several 
decades have brought the democratization of media and information, but North Koreans are
still propagandized to daily and entirely reliant on their state for views of other peoples,
nations, and the world.
It's been reported that 96% of the world's population recognizes the Coca-Cola logo, but
the DPRK is still officially devoid of such international commercial brands. 


### Mechanics of Getting There
It's actually relatively easy for most foreign tourists to visit the country, you 
just have to go through a tour group that partners with the official North Korean 
local company (which watches you like a hawk while you're there). As U.S. citizens, 
we're then required to fly first into Beijing, and from Beijing to Pyongyang via 
Air Koryo. We personally are going with 
![Young Pioneer Tours](http://www.youngpioneertours.com/) on their St. Patrick's Day
themed tour, which includes a pub crawl in Pyongyang. 

### Pre-Trip Happenings

Otto Warmbier
Visa shenanigans

### Overall Profound Thoughts?

### Time in Beijing
Extremely hot hotpot
National Performing Arts Center 

### Day 1

Can't believe this is really happening! 
Flight: good beer, famous female band, crazy infamous Chicken sandwich 

Clearing security: one dicey moment, but in general much less strict than expected. 
Didn't log into chromebook. 

Meet tour guides! Talk with Mr. Kim about Otto Warmbier. Let's be respectful of
local customs and make good memories. Every country has good people and bad people.

First impressions of Pyongyang: doesn't look that different from China...
Taxis, lots of foreign vehicles. 
Arch of Triumph - is it the biggest one? 
Reunification gate thing

Paintings of the leaders are everywhere

Yanggakdo Hotel - lots of services. Truly on an isolated island. 

Dinner strangely has Western food! 

### Day 2

DMZ

Tour from a military soldier. Various photos in the buildings. 
If the US provokes another Korean war, we will smash them. Our country is the most powerful state.

US provoked the Korean war, suffered losses, suggested peace talks. 

US hide the shame of defeat, used the UN flag. Ran away at the end without the flag. This is evidence
of their defeat in the Korean War and the aggressive nature of the US.

Lunch at a place with a lot of bowls. Dog soup, dog penis...

Vile snake liquor...

Sariwon City

Duck BBQ restaurant

Talk with Ms. Kim about puppet army

### Day 3 - St Patrick's Day!

Day of contrasts

Morning bowing

Pub crawl! Get pictures from Albert

Shooting

Dinner place with dancing...

### Day 4

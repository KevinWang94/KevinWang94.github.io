### Intro

And so we came to our final Stan: Uzbekistan. It contains the lion's share
of famous Silk Road cities such as [Samarkand](XX) and [Khiva](XX)
and is where we spent most of our time this trip (around a week).


Thankfully, walking across the border by ourselves from Tajikistan
wasn't a problem, and we were met on the other side by our guide for the entire
week, Utkir, as well as our driver, Erkin. A white Chevrolet, just like
everyone else in this country.


### Samarkand


The first night in Samarkand, we went to a pretty fancy restaurant that had
live music. Various groups. Comments about Islam.

The next day was sightseeing in the earnest. Samarkand definitely has the
most quintessentially beautiful buildings of Central Asia, albeit because
they have all been restored. Highlights included the XXX Mausoleum Complex,
as well as the Timur tombstone. And of course, the Registon, three
madressas at the center of the city. 

For lunch Plov lunch, glorious plov. Comment about the Orlando shootings. 

### Bukhara

Adventure for Watermelon.

Next day: MacBurger City! 

### Ayazkala: Yurt Stay!

Camels just chilling. Initially concerned about the food, given comments made
by Utkir. But it turned out to be quite good, and we met a kindred spirit
traveler, a retired gentleman named Michael who was also traveling across
Central Asia, and had previously been to both North Korea and Iran.

### Khiva



### Tashkent

Busy with the preparations for the Six Nations Summit. 

Plov center.

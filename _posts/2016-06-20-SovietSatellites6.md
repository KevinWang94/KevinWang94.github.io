### Intro

And so we came to our final Stan: Uzbekistan. It contains the lion's share
of famous Silk Road cities such as
[Samarkand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand) and
[Khiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khiva)
and is where we spent most of our time this trip (around a week). As such,
this post will be a bit less detailed than the others.

Thankfully, walking across the border by ourselves from Tajikistan
wasn't a problem despite all those scary stories from Boz, and
we were met on the other side by our guide for the entire
week, Utkir, as well as our driver, Erkin.

### Samarkand

From the border, we drove to our first city, Samarkand. We were welcomed at
dinner with, what else, vodka. The restaurant also had live music, with various
groups getting up to dance, from older women to a band of high school guys.
It was definitely more raucous than I expected given Ramadan, more on this later.
Here's a bad picture of some of the dancing:

The next day was sightseeing in the earnest. Samarkand definitely has the
most quintessentially beautiful buildings of Central Asia, with stunning
tilework and blue domes. Though unfortunately, this is only because of
aggressive restorations throughout. Highlights included the
[Shah-i-Zinda Mausoleum Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah-i-Zinda)
with its beautiful tilework:

as well as the [Mausoleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gur-e-Amir)
of Uzbekistan's national hero, [Timur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur).
And of course, the Registan, three madrasas at the center of the city:

In Samarkand, we also experienced
[Uzbek plov](https://munchies.vice.com/en/recipes/uzbek-plov)
for the first time. Or as our guidebook described it, "plov, glorious plov."
It's a cousin of pilaf, but with the rice cooked in a fatty, meaty stew.
Every region of the country has its own variant, which is of course the best.
Here's a shot of our Samarkand plate (one big one for the whole table):

On our way out of 

### Bukhara

Adventure for Watermelon.

Next day: MacBurger City! 

### Ayazkala: Yurt Stay!

Camels just chilling. Initially concerned about the food, given comments made
by Utkir. But it turned out to be quite good, and we met a kindred spirit
traveler, a retired gentleman named Michael who was also traveling across
Central Asia, and had previously been to both North Korea and Iran.

### Khiva



### To Tashkent

We took an evening flight 
[Tashkent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tashkent) is Uzbekistan's capital
and also Central Asia's largest city. It and Almaty were definitely the most
modern cities we visited.

Plov center. 

Our vehicle for the week was a
trusty white Chevrolet, like basically every other car in the country.
This is really only a slight exaggeration, we routinely had trouble finding
our car in a sea of identical white sedans.

### Intro

And so we came to our final Stan: Uzbekistan. It contains the lion's share
of famous Silk Road cities such as
[Samarkand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand) and
[Khiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khiva)
and is where we spent most of our time this trip (around a week). As such,
this post will be a bit less detailed than the others.

Thankfully, walking across the border by ourselves from Tajikistan
wasn't a problem despite all those scary stories from Boz, and
we were met on the other side by our guide for the entire
week, Utkir, as well as our driver, Erkin. Our vehicle for the week was a
trusty white Chevrolet, like basically every other car in the country.
This is really only a slight exaggeration, as we routinely had trouble finding
our car in a sea of identical white sedans:

Apparently, due to high import taxes for vehicles, most people drive the
Chevrolets produced by
[GM Uzbekistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM_Uzbekistan).

Soon after the border, we also exchanged money for the first time. Uzbekistan
has a black market for USD which is almost twice as good as the official
government rate (around 5800 vs. 3300 while we were there). And while black
market makes it sound sketchy, you can basically change money everywhere.
Many storekeepers would openly quote rates at us once they heard
us speaking English. No need for a shifty guy with a trash bag in the bazaar,
though those apparently also exist. In another quirk, Uzbekistan's highest
denomination bill is 5000, less than a single US Dollar! So, paying for anything
in Uzbekistan involves handing over a huge stack of cash. I'm still unclear
as to why they don't print a larger bill...the lost productivity from having
to count cash all the time seems unfortunate. Here's a picture of a hundred
dollar bill and all the [som](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbekistani_som)
it turned into:

### Samarkand

From the border, we drove to our first city, Samarkand. We were welcomed at
dinner with, what else, vodka. The restaurant also had live music, with various
groups getting up to dance, from older women to a band of high school guys.
It was definitely more raucous than I expected given Ramadan, more on this later.
Here's a bad picture of some of the dancing:

The next day was sightseeing in the earnest. Samarkand definitely has the
most quintessentially beautiful buildings of Central Asia, with stunning
tilework and blue domes. Though unfortunately, this is only because of
aggressive restorations throughout. Highlights included the
[Shah-i-Zinda Mausoleum Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah-i-Zinda)
with its beautiful tilework:

as well as the [Mausoleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gur-e-Amir)
of Uzbekistan's national hero, [Timur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur).
And of course, the Registan, three madrasas at the center of the city,
each in stunning blue tile:

In Samarkand, we also experienced
[Uzbek plov](https://munchies.vice.com/en/recipes/uzbek-plov)
for the first time. Or as our guidebook described it, "plov, glorious plov."
It's a cousin of pilaf, but with the rice cooked in a fatty, meaty stewXX.
Every region of the country has its own variant, which is of course the best.
Here's a shot of our Samarkand plate (one big one for the whole table):

On our way out of Samarkand, we stopped by SHarhXX, also built by TimurXX.
It gives a glimpse as to what Samarkand would have looked like without
restorations. Generally, a pretty decent percentage of the tilework is still
preserved:

### Bukhara

Next up was [Bukhara](XX), where we spent three nights (basically one too
many). For me, the highlight here was the Ark Citadel, former residence
of the Emir of Bukhara. It contains the
[bug pit](https://www.vice.com/read/brutality-report-knowledge-of-the-bug-pit)
where Stoddart and Conolly of Great Game fame were kept, and also the
square where they were executed:

![](XX)

Peter Hopkirk's
[The Great Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game_(Peter_Hopkirk_book))
is a great read for anyone interested in this and other stories about
Central Asia, a nonfiction book that reads like an exciting thriller.

The other highlight was the Chor Minor, a XXX,
that also graces the cover of the
[Lonely Planet Central Asia guidebook](XX).
Every traveler we came across in the Stans seemed to have this book.

While in the area, we also saw the Emir's Summer Palace and the mausoleum
of Islail SomoniXX, Tajikistan's national hero.

### Ayazkala: Yurt Stay!

Up next was a yurt stay, actually in the middle of nowhere in the desert:

![](XX)

Unsurprisingly, our guide and driver were not particularly happy about
having to stay there with us. Utkir
asked us why the hell we had chosen to stay here, when there was human
civilization thirty minutes away. But this seemed like an interesting Central
Asian experience, albeit one constructed for tourists. Our camp was complete
with a couple camels just chilling, a the ruins of a fort in the background:

![](XX)

Despite Utkir's warnings about the accomodations and food, we actually had
a pretty good time. The yurt was right next to these ancient forts that were
fun to climb up and around:

We also met a kindred spirit traveler while staying at the yurts,
a retired gentleman named Michael who was also traveling across
Central Asia, and had recently been to both North Korea and Iran.
Hopefully I'm that cool when I'm older!

### Khiva

From Ayazkala we drove to Khiva for the day, basically a well-preserved
old city, a "museum city" as our guidebook described it. Unfortunately, by
this point in the trip I was a little tired of seeing blue tiled madrasahsXX,
and it was punishingly hot outside. But, in hindsight, it really was a beautiful
area, and climbing out on the old city walls was a good time. 

### To Tashkent

We took an evening flight to
[Tashkent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tashkent), Uzbekistan's capital
and also Central Asia's largest city. It and Almaty were definitely the most
modern cities we visited. The flight was completely ridiculous, beginning with
these hand-written boarding passes:

![](XX)

Then, once on the plane, we realized that the seats weren't fixed, being
able to fold completely down and forward. The many unoccupied seats of course
all did this upon landing. In addition, our checked luggage was merely dragged
into the cabin for us, and we could see compressed oxygen streaming into the
cabin and all the condensation it caused:

![](XX)

Thankfully, we made it to Tashkent in one piece, only to find that our initial
hotel completely booked on account of an upcoming meeting of the
[Shanghai Cooperation Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation).
The next day, we did some sightseeing in Tashkent, including lunch at the
[National Plov Center](XX).
Look at these huge batches of plov!

![](XX)

For our last dinner, we went to this Uzbek fast food clone, BBQ Burger,
and finished up with a "cocktail." We had strugled all day to actually find
cocktails, with most places' cocktails actually just being smoothies.
This one bar supposedly had only one drink, a Long Island Iced Tea, which turned
out to basically be some sort of orange juice and liquor concoction...

From here it was time to say goodbye to Utkir and the Stans, onwards to
Moldova! A picture of the three of us from the last day:

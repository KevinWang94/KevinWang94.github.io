### Day 7: Over the Andes!

We got up bright and early to take a bus from Santiago to 
[Mendoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendoza,_Argentina), just over the border
with Argentina. From there, we would fly to Buenos Aires. Why subject ourselves to
this bus journey instead of directly flying? Well, the ride through the Andes
is supposed to be absolutely beautiful.
[This blogger](http://weekendblitz.com/bus-ride-andes-santiago-mendoza/)
described it as "one of the most memorable parts of our trip and...a day of sites that were postcard-worthy."
So we made sure to bus our tickets on the first day they became available,
securing the top two seats on the upper level.

The bus station itself was less chaotic than we feared, given what we'd
read on the internet beforehand. Note that Santiago confusingly has several
different bus stations, some (but not all) of which are next to each other, so
make sure to go to the right one. The process of boarding our bus on the other hand,
was much less peaceful. Despite the general lack of tourists in Santiago, I for some
reason had still expected the bus to be a mix of locals and foreigners. But it
instead seemed to be almost wholly composed of people moving their entire
worldly possessions between Chile and Argentina. There was massive chaos in trying
to get everyone's bags, boxes, suitcases, etc. onto the bus. Someone later
mentioned that due to the weakness of one currency relative to another, it'd become
financially advantageous to shop across the border, so perhaps that was it?
Regardless, there was one poor over-stressed employee trying to load everyone's bags
on as people jockied around him in both mass- and line-like shapes.
But we finally managed to make it onto the bus, and departed around 40
minutes late. I'd left a bit of a buffer between our bus' arrival in Mendoza and
our departing flight due to the uncertainties of the bording crossing, so hopefully
we would be okay?

The first hour or two of the ride was pretty uneventful, just getting to the Andes themselves.
So unsurprisingly we both fell asleep. 
But at some point, I awoke and observed us pulled off the highway and parked on the
side of some random road. I was a bit perplexed, had our bus broken down in some way?
But soon I noticed many other large buses doing the same exact thing. After quite a long
period of confusion (it didn't seem like there were even announcements in Spanish), we
gathered that the
[mountain pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paso_Internacional_Los_Libertadores)
was temporarily closed due to bad weather. As this was November in Chile (the equivalent of
May in the Northern Hempishere), I was a bit surprised. At some point, the driver contemplated
turning back, but the bus collectively loudly opposed this, so we continued to sit and wait.
We ended up waiting for about two hours overall, by the end of which I was hoping we would turn
back. Had we continued at that point, we would've missed our flight (one of the last out
of Mendoza) and been stranded for the evening without accomodation. 
Thankfully, the bus drivers seemed to all decide
at once to turn back, so we headed on back to Santiago. On the journey back, I attempted
to buy last-minute Santiago -> Buenos Aires flights, but despite trying several credit cards and
expensive foreign phone calls with Chase, our charges kept getting denied. So we instead
went directly to the airport, and purchased our flights at the
[Sky Airline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Airline)
counter. My first (and hopefully only) time buying tickets at the airport. 
Thankfully, they weren't too expensive, yay for low cost carriers! We proceeded
to camp out in an airport lounge for the next several hours (with unlimited smoked salmon!), 
not wanting to do anything else for the day.

The flight itself was uneventful, but our upgrade luck had run out, as we ended up in the
non-reclining very last row with discount-airline legroom. At least the cabin was covered
with ads!

But given the flight's duration, it didn't really matter. And we were just thankful to have
made it to Buenos Aires without any delay (albeit having missed out on our Andes views).
This was really one of the most depressing travel days I've ever done, but hopefully
the last two days of our vacation would be better!

### Day 8: Day Trip to Uruguay

The Uruguayan city of 
[Colonia del Sacramento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonia_del_Sacramento)
is located just across the 
[Rio de la Plata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%ADo_de_la_Plata)
from Buenos Aires, and accessible via ~2hr ferry ride. I of course couldn't resist this opportunity
for a day trip that picked up another country, so off we went.
We booked our tickets via Seacat in advance online, though be warned that they definitely overcharge
for this privilege. The peace of mind seemed worth it though, I'd changed it for Macau with bad results.
We were up bright and early for the ferry ride, which was pretty uneventful, though note that you
clear both country's immigrations before getting onto the ferry, so leave enough time
before departure (probably at least 30 minutes).

Colonia itself is this small little town that seems pretty heavily touristed. 
Most of its downtown shows the obvious Portuguese colonial legacy, another similarity with Macau. 
The main things that one can reach without a car include several old town sights, 
including the town gate and lighthouse:

There are also a couple of museums, some of which I heard would be free. 
But the couple that we ducked our heads in had entrance fees in Uruguayan pesos, which we didn't have. 
We must've seemed like the poorest backpackers ever, unable to pay 50 cent entrance fees!
The city is talked about online as a wonderful day trip from Buenos Aires, a getaway from the hustle
and bustle to explore a cute little town and sit on the water. Though note that the water is pretty
brown and gross, especially sad after the perfectly blue ocean off of Easter Island.
After visiting, I think if you're
a traveler like me, you can probably spend at most half a day here without a car before getting bored.
We even walked back to the ferry terminal two hours early hoping to get on an earlier departure,
but there sadly wasn't one. Perhaps I would've felt different had I been able to make it to some
further our places, like the 
[Granja Colonia](XX)
museum. It boasts one of the world's largest collections of pencils, amongst many other things.
And is alternately described in its Tripadvisor reviews as an off-the-beaten-path or a mundane
hoarder's cache. Regardless, I think if I were to do it again, I'd have just planned for a half
a day in Colonia, or a full day in Montevideo (about two more hours on the ferry as I recall).

### Steak!

After getting back to Buenos Aires, we headed right for 
[Parilla Pena](http://www.parrillapenia.url.ph/)
a no-nonsense steakhouse frequented by locals and tourists alike. Steak's a big deal
in Argentina, and we were understandably very excited. As
[this article](https://www.eater.com/2017/9/21/16329524/best-parrillas-steaks-buenos-aires-argentina)
describes it: "To put it simply, steak is life, and the parrilla, a holy temple of worship."
I'd chosen this particluar parilla based on the glowing recommendation of a 
[Youtuber I follow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBsau9D4pjo).
And it really didn't disappoint. They include as a free starter here these amazing
empanadas, that were honestly one of the best things I ate this whole trip (though
I was starving). Then came a huge portion of proscuitto as well as some blood sausage
that Lucy bravely ordered. And finally the main event, a wonderfully cooked steak for the
two of us. And despite massively over-ordering, it was still less $30 / person. I would heartily
recommend this place to anyone visiting Argentina. As we were snapping pictures on our way out,
they even let me pose with the grill!

### Day 9: Argentina

This was our last day, as we flew out on Sunday evening red-eyes (so I could be at work
Monday morning, yay!). Between our general exhaustion and my awful sunburn, we took
this day pretty easy.

I had a wonderful time in South America, and hope to back soon for the continent's other 
beautiful places like the 
[Salar de Uyuni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salar_de_Uyuni).

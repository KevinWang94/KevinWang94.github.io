This begins a series of blog posts about my Summer 2016 Sojourn to a variety
of Soviet Satellite States (yay alliteration). In particular, I'm traveling
to (in order): Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and
Moldova. I'm actually trying to write these posts while on the road...we'll
see how this goes.

As with the last several trips chronicled here, I'm traveling with Aaron
through these countries.. This part of my summer was originally conceived
as a journey across the Silk Road, as I wanted to make some sort of larger
journey given that vacation-starved full-time life is looming. I actually seriously
considered the overland experiences offered by companies such as
[Oasis Overland](http://www.oasisoverland.co.uk/)
and [Dragoman](https://www.dragoman.com/),
which at their most extreme are several-month journeys
from Istanbul to Beijing, completely by overland vehicle.
I of course came to my senses and realizing that three months of
land travel while camping in the bush might
be...non-ideal. But, these sorts of trips do look really cool in general,
and I'm hoping to go on a shorter one sometime soon.
We instead lined up a local tour operator,
[Steppe Journeys](http://www.steppejourneys.com/)
for a three week, East to West tour through the five formerly Soviet
Stans (all of them except Pakistan and Afghanistan).

Of course, we couldn't just stop there! We realized that the cheapest
flight to Almaty, Kazakhstan actually stopped in Kiev, and it was no
cost to add a couple of extra days there. This gave us time to  do a Chernobyl
day tour. Then, we unfortunately found out that Turkmenistan had
denied our visa applications, for unknown reasons. Perhaps they thought
that I was a hacker, or Aaron some regime-changing revolutionary. Or maybe
it was just the caprice of one of the world's most authoritarian states.
We were only given a wondefully official document, which stated in Turkmen:
"These are the names of the people whose visa applications have been denied."
So, we decided to use the extra couple of days to visit Moldova, and
in particular the breakaway state of Transnistria. It's a small
strip of land between Ukraine and Moldova, which apparently still wants
to be part of the Soviet Union. It's often described in Western media as a
dangerous hotbed of corruption and criminal activity, an opinion echoed
by a Romanian friend of ours. But, some poking around on the internet seemed
to indicate that visiting is quite safe. We shall see in two weeks.

And so the journey begins, first up is Kiev and Chernobyl!

This begins a series of blog posts about my Summer 2016 Sojourn to a variety
of Soviet Satellite States (yay alliteration). In particular, I'm traveling
to (in order): Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and
Moldova. I'm actually trying to write these posts while on the road...we'll
see how this goes.

As with the last several trips chronicled here, I'm traveling with Aaron
Roper for this part of my summer. The trip was originally conceived
as a journey across the Silk Road, as I wanted to make some sort of larger
journey with vacation-starved full-time life looming. I actually seriously
considered the overland journeys offered by companies such as
[Oasis Overland](http://www.oasisoverland.co.uk/)
and [Dragoman](https://www.dragoman.com/)
which at their most extreme, are several-month journeys
from Istanbul to Beijing, completely by overland vehicle.
I of course came to my senses and realizing that three months of
being stuck in an overlanding vehicle and camping in the bush might
be...non-ideal. But, these sorts of trips do look really cool in general,
and I'm hoping to go on a shorter one sometime soon.
We instead lined up a local tour operator,
[Steppe Journeys](http://www.steppejourneys.com/)
for a three week tour, East to West through the five formerly Soviet
Stans.

Of course, we couldn't just stop there. We realized that the cheapest
flight to Almaty, Kazakhstan actually stopped in Kiev, and it was no
cost to add an extra stop there, from which we could do a Chernobyl
day tour. Then, we found out that Turkmenistan had unfortunately
denied our visa applications, for unknown reasons. Perhaps they thought
that I was a hacker, or Aaron some regime-changing revolutionary. Or maybe
it was just the caprice of one of the world's most authoritarian states.
We were only given a wondefully official document, which stated in Turkmen:
"These are the names of the people whose visa applications have been denied."
So, we decided to use the extra couple of days to visit Moldova, and
in particular the breakaway state of Transnistria. It's a small
strip of land between Ukraine and Moldova, which apparently still wants
to be part of the Soviet Union. More information to in the post
detailing our visit! 

And so the journey begins, first up is Kiev and Chernobyl.

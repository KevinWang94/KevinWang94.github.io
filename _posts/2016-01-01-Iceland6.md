###Day 6: Stranded

Next morning, we woke up to a terrible snowstorm, and realized we were stranded at least stranded
for the time being. We settled in: I started catching up on CS181 lecture videos
(midterm after the break)
while Aaron, being ahead on all his work, watched House of Cards instead while eating
an entire bag of licorice from Bonus. Here's our setup while stranded:

This was also the day that we realized the full extent of the car damage. It seems that we had
pushed part of the front fender in while pushing the car out of the snow (great durability I know)
which was then exacerbated everytime we opened the driver-side door:

Realizing we'd be stranded for the night, we walked our way over
to the main office and paid for one more day with the nice lady. Unfortunately, this is a trip
we would have to make again. Just like in the movies, we actually had to dig ourselves out of the door,
as there was a snowdrift up against it. And on the way there, we almost got blown over by the wind.

We finished our uneventful day by watching *Up in the Air*, hoping that the next morning would bring
better weather.

###Day 7: Still Stranded...

Unfortunately, the roads somehow managed to get worse! We were now totally boxed in on both sides.

On the bright side, we are, after several attempts, get our flight rescheduled to one day later
at no extra charge! And also, we determined that VISA would likely cover the damages to our rental
vehicle! We finished out the night by watching *Catching Fire* after absolutely failing to make
steamed vegetables with improper cookware. By the end of this day, we were really starting to get
cabin fever, and strongly hoped for better weather.

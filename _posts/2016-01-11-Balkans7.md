###Day 10: Sofia

This was a lazy and relaxed day, as we had finished sightseeing in Sofia.
To sate my love of McDonald's, we went especially to one downton. A bit disappointing,
as there didn't seem to be any special local sandwiches. But I did get to sit in this awesome
birthday chair!

Dinner was at a "Chinese" restaurant called Wok to Wok, where you chose a bunch of ingredients
and they combined them in a wok for you. All of my credit cards awkwardly got declined because
my travel alert had expired by this point (the checkout lady was not amused when four in a row
didn't work). Aaron thankfully saved the day, as he was smart enough to pad his travel
alert.

###Day 11:
Being classic Kevin and Aaron, we got to the airport ridiculously early this morning,
and had some time to kill.
Aaron bought some rakia from the duty free store, and we flew to Amsterdam.
The Amsterdam airport is strange in that there is security at every gate instead of at
a centralized location. Beyond security is this tiny waiting area, so Aaron and I decided
that we'd wait until the last minute to go through, especially when we heard that our flight was
slightly delayed (we just couldn't catch a break!). Unfortunately, when we at least went
through security, we were totally accosted by this lady who seemed to be just from the airline
and not any sort of security services.
We got pulled aside individually and asked all sorts of questions:
Who purchased your tickets? Who have you been traveling with? What do you guys do?
What was your exact itinerary over the last week?
(pretty hard to remember given all the countries!) etc.
I still don't understand what we did wrong...but anyway, they finally let us go and onto the plane.
And we did succesfully make it back stateside, woohoo!

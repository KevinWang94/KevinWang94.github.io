### Day 4: The Last

This was sadly our last day in Svalbard, with our flight leaving in the afternoon.
We got a late start in the morning, first day of the trip we could sleep in!
After breakfast and packing, we headed to the [Svalbard Museum](https://svalbardmuseum.no/en/).
It was a fine museum, and we didn't really have anything else planned that morning, so I'm not 
sad that we went. But, I do feel like I hit peak museum at around 
age 16 or something, and every year since then I've become a little less tolerant of staring
at things in glass boxes. It does have a good mix of info about Svalbard's geography, 
human history, and wildlife. There's a stuffed polar bear:

and also a fake coal miner's tunnel that I convinced Daniel to experience:

Warning: it's a little tricky to emerge from, as Daniel found out:

The museum also has some great quotes about life in the artic.

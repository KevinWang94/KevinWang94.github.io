### Day 4: The Last

This was sadly our last day in Svalbard, with our flight leaving in the afternoon.
We got a late start in the morning; first day of the trip we could sleep in!
After breakfast and packing, we headed to the [Svalbard Museum](https://svalbardmuseum.no/en/).
It was a fine museum, and we didn't really have anything else planned that morning, so I'm not 
sad that we went. But, I do feel like I hit peak museum at around 
age 16, and every year since then I've become a little less tolerant of staring
at things in glass boxes. It does have a good mix of information about Svalbard's geography, 
human history, and wildlife. There's also a stuffed polar bear:

and a fake coal miner's tunnel that I convinced Daniel to experience:

Warning: it's a little tricky to emerge from, as he found out:

After the museum, we stopped quickly for a sandwich, and then did the ~hour-long
walk to the airport. We'd let ourselves miss the shuttle, but it's
scheduled so early that we ended up arriving with enough time, 
especially given the small size of the Longyearbyen Airport.
Who did we run into there? The grumpy Norwegian couple! We just noticed
them as I threw a packet of Haribo gummies at Michal, perfect timing.
Unfortunately, they weren't seated near us on the plane.

On the tarmac, we watched the arrival of a Norwegian Air plane before
taking off for Tromso. Our flight going back this direction stopped
there before Oslo, with everyone having to get out to clear passport
control and customs before boarding what was then a domestic Norwegian flight. 
This meant that we did have to enter the Schengen Zone, which 
I was surprised by as I wasn't asked for any passport info while 
booking these flights. This did give me the chance to leave the airport
and step on the soil of Norway-proper.

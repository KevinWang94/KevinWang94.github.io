This begins a series of blog posts about my spring break 2016 trip to the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea with Aaron Roper (stopping for a couple days in Beijing en route). I'm writing
this first post from Beijing before leaving for Pyongyang, but all the later ones will be 
retroactive as we won't have internet access while in the DPRK. 

### Introduction

After Iceland and the Balkans, we obviously had to up the craziness for third and final
installment of our spring break travel, so we of course settled on North Korea! 
I realize this choice is...unorthodox so thie first post is dedicated mostly to explaining 
myself. 

### Why North Korea

First, please see my previous post about traveling philosophy for a general sense of why 
I go to countries that are off the beaten path. 

Specific to this trip, the DPRK is just an incredibly fascinating place for many reasons. 
The last several 
decades have brought the democratization of media and information, but North Koreans are
still propagandized to daily and entirely reliant on their state for views of other peoples,
nations, and the world.
It's been reported that 96% of the world's population recognizes the Coca-Cola logo, but
the DPRK is still officially devoid of such international commercial brands. 


### Mechanics of Getting There
It's actually relatively easy for most foreign tourists to visit the country, you 
just have to go through a tour group that partners with the official North Korean 
local company (which watches you like a hawk while you're there). As U.S. citizens, 
we're then required to fly first into Beijing, and from Beijing to Pyongyang via 
Air Koryo. We personally are going with 
![Young Pioneer Tours](http://www.youngpioneertours.com/) on their St. Patrick's Day
themed tour, which includes a pub crawl in Pyongyang.

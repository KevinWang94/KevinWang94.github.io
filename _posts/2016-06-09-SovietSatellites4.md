### Intro

In our largely East to West Kyrgyzstan is definitely the

### Drive to Bishkek

We set off in the morning for Bishkek, getting a taste of the crazy roads that
our guide and driver had mentioned the previous day. People are *incredibly*
aggressive about passing on the single-lane highway, leading us to be within a
second of colliding with oncoming traffic multiple times. The situation is
exacerbated by the variety of cars in this area. Central Asia apparently imports
a lot of used cars from Japan, which drives on the left, despite the fact that
these countries all drive on the right. So, our driver Slava ends up on the
right side of the car, behind a huge truck that's blocking visibility, while
trying to pass on the left. As you might imagine, this leads to a lot of
leftward drifting followed by abrupt right swerving upon seeing an oncoming
car. Thankfully, we survived the four days in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan without
incident. Slava was surprisingly nonchalant about the long days in these driving
conditions. Let's see if Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are any better.

We thankfully exited the country without incident, though the border crossing
was a bit chaotic and confusing at times. No need to bribe my way
out of the country as a friend of mine had done a couple years ago after
misplacing some paperwork.

### Bishkek

In Bishkek, we also wandered around the center city, seeing a similar variety
of parks and statues. At one location, they had relocated a statue of Lenin,
only to replace it with one of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels! 
And of course, across the street was a former Communist Party building 
since converted into the American University of Central Asia:

Here's that statue of Lenin, still in a prominent location. Apparently, Lenin
remains quite respected in the area, as he put a stop to many cruel policies 
by the Czar. On the other hand, Stalin is unsurprisingly less
revered, having enacted the forced settlement of many of the area's nomadic 
peoples amongst other misdeeds.

We also stopped by one of the city's bazaars, where it seems that anything
can be purchased, from toilet paper to horse sausuges. Here are some colorful
carpets:

And the old women manning various food stalls:

Dinner that evening was a reminder of East Asian influence in the area, as
I had these distinctly Chinese-looking noodles:

### Day 2: Leaving Bishkek

On our second day in Kyrgyzstan, we left Bishkek on the way to Central Asia's
largest lake Issyl Kol, ststopping at a couple of sights along the way. First up
was Burana Tower, a 11th century brick minaret that was aggressively restored
by the Soviets in the 1950s. Zakir even described it as Kyrgyzstan's Pisa, as
the tower has a slight lean to it despite the restoration:

After Burana, we headed to Lake Issyl-Kol, which really is massive. It's the second largest
alpine lake in tthe world after Lake Titicaca in South America,
and the second deepest after Lake Baikal. It seems to be about the size of Lake Erie.

From the lake, we went to the Grigorievka Gorge, north of the lake. In the gorge
we passed many men on horseback herding livestock, as well as people erecting
yurts. Not exactly how similar this was to ""traditional" Kyrgyz life, but this
was probably the cloest we got to it. Unfortunately, the road to the three
alpine lakes was probably the longest and bumpiest I've done in about 10 years.

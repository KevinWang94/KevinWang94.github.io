### Intro

In our largely East to West itinerary, Kyrgyzstan was up next. It holds several
distinctions amongst the Stans, being both the most difficult to spell
as well as the most democratic.

### Drive to Bishkek

We set off in the morning for Bishkek, getting a taste of the crazy roads that
our guide and driver had mentioned the previous day. People are *incredibly*
aggressive about passing on the single-lane highway, leading us to be within a
second of colliding with oncoming traffic multiple times. The situation is
exacerbated by the variety of cars in this area. Central Asia apparently imports
a lot of used cars from Japan, which drives on the left, despite the fact that
these countries all drive on the right. So, our driver Slava ends up on the
right side of the car, behind a huge truck that's blocking visibility, while
trying to pass on the left. As you might imagine, this leads to a lot of
leftward drifting followed by abrupt right swerving upon seeing an oncoming
car. Thankfully, we survived the four days in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan without
incident. Slava was surprisingly nonchalant about the long days in these driving
conditions. Let's see if Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are any better.

We thankfully exited the country without incident, though the border crossing
was a bit chaotic and confusing at times. No need to bribe my way
out of the country as a friend of mine had done a couple years ago after
misplacing some paperwork.

### Bishkek

In Bishkek, we also wandered around the center city, seeing a similar variety
of parks and statues. At one location, they had relocated a statue of Lenin,
only to replace it with one of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels! 
And of course, across the street was a former Communist Party building 
since converted into the American University of Central Asia:

Here's that statue of Lenin, still in a prominent location. Apparently, Lenin
remains quite respected in the area, as he put a stop to many cruel policies 
by the Czar. On the other hand, Stalin is unsurprisingly less
revered, having enacted the forced settlement of many of the area's nomadic 
peoples amongst other misdeeds.

It was while in Bishkek that we heard a bit about the country's two recent
revolutions, from [2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_Revolution)
and [2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyz_Revolution_of_2010)
both of which deposed national leaders. This makes Kyrgyzstan unique amongst
the Stans, as Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan are all still led by the
original post-Soviet leader, and Turkmenistan was as well until
[Niyazov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saparmurat_Niyazov)
passed away in 2006.

We also stopped by one of the city's bazaars, where it seems that anything
can be purchased, from toilet paper to horse sausuges. Here are some colorful
carpets:

And the old women manning various food stalls:

Dinner that evening was a reminder of East Asian influence in the area, as
I had these distinctly Chinese-looking noodles:

### Day 2: Bishkek to Issyk-Kul

On our second day in Kyrgyzstan, we left Bishkek on the way to Central Asia's
largest lake [Issyk-Kul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issyk-Kul),
stopping at a couple of sights along the way. First up
was Burana Tower, a 11th century brick minaret that was aggressively restored
by the Soviets in the 1950s. Zakir even described it as Kyrgyzstan's Pisa, as
the tower has a slight lean to it despite the restoration:

After Burana, we headed to the lake, which really is quite massive. There's
also some thermal activity in the depths, meaning it was reasonably warm
despite the altitude. We waded into the water a bit, and Aaron was able to
get a swim in the following morning.

From the lake, we went North to the Grigorievka Gorge. While there,
we passed many men on horseback herding livestock, as well as people erecting
yurts. Not exactly sure how similar this was to "traditional" Kyrgyz life, but
this was probably the cloest we got to it. Unfortunately, the road to the three
alpine lakes was probably the longest and bumpiest I've done in a decade.
Frankly while the lakes were beautiful, it was probably not worth the extra
distance up the gorge. And of course, it began to rain right around when we
reached the lakes. This made the couple tiny streams we had driven through
a bit more harrowing on the way back. Again, Slava seemed unfazed and did an
excellent job getting us back. I, on the other hand, was largely asleep. Here's
a shot of our vehicle from this day:

### Day 3: Back to Almaty

Due to our late return the previous evening, we had pushed visiting the
[Cholpan-Ata Petroglyphs](http://www.advantour.com/kyrgyzstan/cholpon-ata-petroglyphs.htm)
to this last day. They were quite interesting, though we were a bit surprised
to see them just out in the open air and able to be touched by anyone.
Our guide traced out several of the glyphs with his hands...

We then just spent the rest of the day driving all the way back to
Almaty. As the crow flies, it's not terribly long, but there are these
damn mountains in the way. This meant that we had to drive basically
back to Bishkek and then from there to Almaty, again making the chaotic
border crossing.

Our adventures in Kazakhstan weren't quite done though. We had seen all these
signs around Almaty for McDonald's, so we went searching for one, as I
especially enjoy international McDonald's. Unfortunately,
we ended up at what was apparently their corporate office instead of a
food-serving location. We were told that real establishments had sadly not
yet arrived. So instead, we went to this somewhat
swanky place for dinner, and managed to run out of local currency, which
was quite embarassing. The meal was even quite affordable by American standards:
around $10 each. But given that all our other meals had been less than half that,
it somehow seemed crazy expensive. After a brief panic, Zakir found some extra
Kazakh money, and we were able to pay him back by going to exchange our
extra Kyrgyz currency. 

The next morning, we said goodbye to Zakir and Slava, and left Almaty
airport toward Dushanbe, Tajikistan! Here's a picture of the four of us
together, many thanks to the both of them:

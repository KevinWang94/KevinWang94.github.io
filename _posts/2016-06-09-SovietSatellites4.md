### Intro

### Drive to Bishkek

We set off in the morning for Bishkek, getting a taste of the crazy roads that
our guide and driver had mentioned the previous day. People are *incredibly*
aggressive about passing on the single-lane highway, leading us to be within a
second of colliding with oncoming traffic multiple times. The situation is
exacerbated by the variety of cars in this area. Central Asia apparently imports
a lot of used cars from Japan, which drives on the left, despite the fact that
these countries all drive on the right. So, our driver Slava ends up on the
right side of the car, behind a huge truck that's blocking visibility, while
trying to pass on the left. As you might imagine, this leads to a lot of
leftward drifting followed by abrupt right swerving upon seeing an oncoming
car. Thankfully, we survived the four days in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan without
incident. Slava was surprisingly nonchalant about the long days in these driving
conditions. Let's see if Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are any better.

### Bishkek

In Bishkek, we also wandered around the center city, seeing a similar variety
of parks and statues. At one location, they had relocated a statue of Lenin,
only to replace it with one of Karl Marx and Freidrich Engels"

And of course, across the street was a former Community Party building 
since converted into the American University of Central Asia:

Here's that statue of Lenin, still in a prominent location. Apparently, Lenin
is still quite respected in the area, as he put a stop to many cruel policies 
by the Czar in this area. On the other hand, Stalin is unsurprisingly less
revered, having enacted the forced settlement of many of the area's nomadic 
peoples (XXXX).

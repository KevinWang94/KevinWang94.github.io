IN PROGRESS DON'T READ
As promised, here are some haphazard reflective / summarizing thoughts about my
week in North Korea.


### Tour Happenings and People

#### Fellow Travelers

As you might imagine, people heading to North Korea are not exactly your
average traveler, and I had a great time getting to know some of the other
people on our tour. There were several experienced travelers (at least one
person was over 100 countries), and I've been seeing great pictures on my
Facebook feed recently from all over the world while I'm stuck in classes...
And unsurprisingly, the people on the tour were quite well-informed
about the world. I probably had more logical discussions about Trump this week
than any other (they mostly began with foreigners asking me what the hell is wrong
with America).
Interestingly enough, the tour also included a lot of folks in the tech sector,
I'd say around a third. Which I guess makes some amount of sense given
job flexibility and income to travel like this, but it was still unexpected.

There is definitely a group of global travelers that have friends
all over the world, with couches to crash on no matter where they are. Maybe
this trip is my first venture into that community! Thanks to everyone on
the tour for a great time.

#### Interactions with Locals

This is perhaps the question I've received most since returning: did I really
get to talk to any locals? Aside from our three guides and then other local guides
and waitresses, the answer is basically no. The closest we got was waving to
schoolchildren while on the bus and walking about, and also that picture I took
with the adorable child on the subway.

While the tour wasn't as strict as we had anticipated, we still weren't given
free reign to speak to locals, and even if we had, I'm not sure I would have
taken the risk to have interesting or profound conversations. And of course,
given the language barrier, it may not have even been possible. This is definitely
unfortunate: I would have really loved the chance to have an honest and frank
conversation with locals (especially the children). But the tour is designed for
this to be impossible, and taking unnecessary risks to speak with locals
didn't seem like a good idea.

Unmonitored activities really were discouraged. For example, Albert at one point
tried to buy something from a local food stand, and our driver ran over to
tell him that was not okay.

#### How Real Was It?

This question was at the back of our minds the whole time, how much of what
we were seeing was a charade? The first thing to realize is that even if
everything we saw (shoppers at the department store, children on school tours,
weddings, etc.) was real, we still did not receive anywhere near a holistic
picture of North Korea. Just leaving in Pyongyang
is a mark of favor in the DPRK, with the standard of living there being much
higher than the rest of the country. I've even read that families with
outwardly disabled children are sent away from the city. The DPRK is battling
malnutrition, tuberculosis, and a host of other problems. But we were kept
well away from even having the chance to see those problems.

There were also parts of our itinerary that did seem constructed. For example,
a ridiculous number of beautiful wedding parties seem to follow us wherever we
went, from Kim Il Sung's birthplace to the Mansudae monument:

In addition, the other "customers" in the department store seemed to be gone
when Aaron and Albert returned an hour to pick up a couple more things.
In addition, the number of bowlers at the bowling alley seemed to markedly
decrease right around us leaving. It's impossible to know if these were all
just coincidences noticed by my paranoid self. Another perfectly reasonable
explanation is that there just isn't that much local demand for such luxury
services. After all, we almost never saw locals in the various restaurants
or bars that we frequented.

In addition, it's very possible that every single scene we saw was constructed
or at least sanitized in some way given that our itinerary was fixed well
in advance. It could have just been simple things: on our visit to the DMZ
all poor neighboring villagers could've been told to stay out of their fields
and off the roads. Work units could have "chosen" to visit the Mausoleum
on the same day as us wearing their very best. And officials could have
removed any unsavory looking characters for the subway for the one hour we
were there. I'm not necessarily saying that this did occur. Given the
immense scale of scenes such as the subway, I'd probably bet against it.
But, a highly authoritarian and centralized state like the DPRK certainly
has the capacity for doing so.

One moment in the trip did lead me to believe that our itineraries were
promulgated at least a bit. We made a random stop, I think in Sariwon but
I'm not sure, 
and I had just remembered that we had brought a bunch of Lindt truffles to
give to children. We walked off the bus to meet some, when our guide
Mr. Pang pulled us back. Apparently, tour groups had just recently started
making stops at this location or something, so perhaps not everyone had been
given the proper directives regarding foreigners. They also might have
been more wary because this wasn't in Pyongyang.

#### How Restrictive Was It? 

[An article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/opinion/sunday/please-cancel-your-vacation-to-north-korea.html)
was just published in the NYTimes which painted tourism in North Korea
as crazy restrictive. And I think the portrayal of events was probably
accurate in 2009, but it's significantly more relaxed now. We spent much
of the week joking around with our guides (more on this later), and as I
mentioned before, they didn't even look through my photos on the way out
of the country or search my bag to the best of my knowledge. It's definitely
not anywhere close to freedom, but it was much more relaxed than we expected
and certainly more relaxed than the article makes it seem. 

#### Our Guides

Before leaving, we were told by the Young Pioneer folks that we would
be joking with our guides by the end of the week, something I didn't
quite believe. But it really was true. Throughout the week, our guides
had casual conversations with us, and made jokes. Ms. Kim started
calling me "didi" (Chinese for little brother).
She also made a couple of jokes about
keeping my passport so that I couldn't leave the country. While I still
laughed, I found those less funny...

### Statements by Guides / Sentiments of North Korean People

Our guides were the only North Koreans that we were truly able to dialogue with, so
their statements are unfortunately the only thing we really have to go on.
Given that they're working in an official capacity, I presume their statements hew
closely to the official positions of the regime and therefore what most North
Koreans are told to believe.

#### Perception of the US

Hate the US government, not the peope.

#### The Division of Korea

Throughout our trip, the guides spoke at length about the painful division of
Korea and the suffering of the Korean people. Even though it likely means the end
of the regime, reunification was loudly proclaimed in both rhetoric and physical
monuments. Our guides spoke of a Korea united by one language, one culture, one blood,
but cruelly split by foreign powers (though I perhaps wouldn't use the same
language, I think this has a lot of truth in it).

#### Perceptions of their Leaders

Mr. Kim repeatedly said that their leaders "devoted their everything" to the
Korean people, and that all Korean people genuinely respect their leaders.
This was used to stress the importance of the various rituals such as bowing,
the implication being that lack of conformity was also disrespectful to the Korean
people at large at not just the Kims. Perhaps this was calculated, as KITC
knew that stressing respect for Kim Jong Un wasn't going to be very effective.

Within Korea, it seems that love for Kim Il Sung is the most prominent. After all,
his birthplace has been turned into a sacred and protected national site. 

I found it interesting that Mr. Kim did acknowledge the difficulties experienced
under Kim Jong Il, citing shortages of food, a lacking of electricity, and
fuel for factories. Of course, this is an extreme under-exaggeration of a famine
that killed hundreds of thousands of people. And his next sentence proclaimed that
Kim Jong Il defended and led the revolution.

#### Relationship with China

#### Ethnicity and National Origin

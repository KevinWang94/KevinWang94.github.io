### Day 5: Exploring Marrakech

Getting to the hostel the night before was a bit of a disaster, as we foolishly decided to
trust Google Maps. Normally, its blue dot is infallible, but in this case, the twisty
roads of the souq weren't mapped. We ended up being led there through a bunch of super
sketchy covered alleyways by a random scruffy-looking stranger who insisted we follow him
when he saw us asking for directions. I continually hung back, convinced that he was
leading us to be mugged in a dark corner.  Thankfully, he actually did get us to the
hostel, though immediately then demanded payment... I think walking through those alleys
is definitely the least safe I've felt in quite a long time when traveling, which is to
say that I've been quite lucky over the last couple of years.

This was our last day in Marrakech, and our first to really see its sights, so 
we tried to make the most of it. Sadly things didn't get off to a great start, 
as the [Bahia Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahia_Palace) was closed.
Thankfully, its older and larger counterpart,
the [El Baci Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Badi_Palace) was open.
For just $2 admission, it was worth the chance to see the ruins and exhibits.
And as I'm writing this post now, I see on the Wikipedia page that it was apparently
paid for by a Portuguese random.

From here we walked toward the
[Jardin Magorelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorelle_Garden), stopping for lunch
along the way. I had my first (tangia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangia] (not to be
confused with tajine), which was quite good.
At the Jardin Magorelle, I experienced perhaps the slowest ticket counter service
in the world, but at least there was a student discount! Amusingly, as I waited 
for what seemed like 20 minutes at the counter, some French ladies behind
me noticed my Harvard ID, and started talking and gesturing at it. I'm not
exactly sure how they thought I wouldn't understand. Even if I didn't speak
French, it's not like "Harvard" in a French accent is that different-sounding...
Regardless, we finally entered the garden, which was honestly a bit disappointing.
Perhaps it would be of great interest to folks interested in Majorelle (I understand
he's a somewhat famous painter) or doing a Yves Saint-Laurent pilgrimage (he paid to
have the garden restored). For me, it seemed like any other small urban garden,
though there was a rather stunning blue building:

After, we cabbed to the Menara Gardens, which were much grander and beautiful.
There was a great reflecting pond surrounded by acres and acres of olive trees:

Sadly our attempts to get up into that building failed.

On our way back to the medina from the gardens, we walked down the XX, which 
seemed to be the site of various modern luxury hotels. We stopped to check our
the Carrefour at the Menara Mall, and had dinner at its open-air food court, with
some fantastic views of the city: It seemed like a mix of tourists, "real locals,"
and expats.

On the second floor, there was even a big arcade with ice skating and bumper cars.
Of course, the best part of it was the: "Naughty Zone" for young children, staffed
by two women who jokingly asked us if we wanted to come in to play...

I imagine they didn't understand why we were laughing so hard.
On the (European) first floor, the mall even had an area mocked up to look like the 
winding souks of the medina, but in a more sterile and peaceful environment. Though,
just as I was noting the lack of harassment to Albert, someone started trying to get 
us to buy his wares.

After dinner, I basically just showered and went to sleep, I was feeling rather sick, 
likely due to days of waking up before 7 and especially that night in the dessert.



Alcohol was hard to find, in that most places seemed to not serve it, even those along
the main square of Marrakech. On the other hand, it was available at the hotel we stayed
at, and for free at the Casablanca Airport Lounge.


One couple from our group peeled off for the evening to another campsite, and it
seems like they were given a more boutique experience, their own tent, and dinner
and entertainment shared with just one other couple. There was apparently an
even more luxurious level, with a private bathroom attached to your tent
in the desert. Given that we had the whole next day on the bus to sleep off the 
terrible night's rest, I didn't really mind the lack of creature comforts for 
an evening, but I imagine I'd feel differently if I, for example, had kids.
I include this info here just so people know that there are other standards of 
accomodation available (for a price of course).

It's definitely tough to determine where the appropriate line-in-the-sand
is. That last luxurious option seems somehow inauthentic, though it's not as if
having a bathroom takes away from the dunes or the stars... And I'm sure there
are many travelers who scoff at my insistence on booking private rooms in hostels.
I felt almost guilty listening to someone else on the tour say to an older couple,
oh, now that you're older and making money and stuff, I guess private rooms make sense.
This was because I was younger than the person making the statement...though I
don't think I'm ever going to convince myself it's worth it to suffer through
a night kept up by snoring to save the price of a single cocktail in NYC.


Summing up Morocco:

I would wholeheartedly recommend Morocco to anyone hoping to go. Even though I know
that I just skimmed the surface. Things that I missed inlude the waterfalls at 
Essouria (where some folks on our tour went the next day) and the famous 
Blue City of [XX](XX). If you don't speak French, prepare for some language difficulties,
but nothing that hand gestures and general flexibility can't overcome.

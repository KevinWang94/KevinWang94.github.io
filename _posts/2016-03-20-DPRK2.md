### Day 1: Welcome to Pyongyang

#### Flight

After a couple of uneventful days in Beijing (highlights include tanghulu and spicy hotpot), we
set off Tuesday morning for airport. It was really happening!

Interestingly enough, we ran into several aid workers traveling to Pyongyang on the same flight
as us, from the [Christian Friends of Korea](http://cfk.org/about-cfk/). I haven't had time to
research the organization since returning, but it was my understanding from a brief chat with them
that they do health-related work all around the country with the approval
of the government. Given the purported opposition to Christianity and their overt name, I was
certainly surprised. I'll hopefully be doing more research on the group soon, and may update
this post later.

The flight was unfortunately not nearly as eventful as I had expected. The plane, while not
exactly a shiny new Boeing, seemed to be Russian and not Soviet, and was perfectly adequate
though landing on Pyongyang was a bit dicey. 
On the plane, we were treated to videos of the famous
[Moranbong Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERLaZ488I6k)
and also got to try the (in)famous Air Koryo burger with our first taste of North Korean beer!

The burger was palatable if not good, imagine a dry and more gristly McChicken with a strange sauce. 
Hoping my foodpic-crazy friends appreciate the effort that went into composing this picture,
I'm especially proud of that sideways bun. The beer on the other hand was very good.

It was also on the plane that we received some cryptic Korean customs forms that amongst other
things, mispelled 'meet' and asked about 'blood ants it's products.'

#### Entering Korea

Before arriving in Korea, Aaron and I were quite careful, removing FB and several other apps
from our phones, and not taking our laptops with us (I did bring a friend's chromebook).
Security turned out to be surprisingly lax though. They did a cursory look at my electronics,
asking me if I had any videos, but otherwise didn't ask me to log into anything. I believe
those who entered via the train faced stricter scrutiny, but in general it seems that fears
were overblown. There was a moment where I was led away to the side and internally panicked a bit,
but that turned out to just be standard. We had made it into the DPRK!

#### Meeting Our Guides

Upon leaving the airport, we quickly loaded ourselves into the local KITC bus, and were
greated by three North Korean guides from the company: Ms. Kim, Mr. Kim, and Mr. Pang.
Here's a shot of our bus, pictures with the guides to come later, they were
absolutely great!

Ms. Kim and Mr. Kim were both on the younger side, and it seemed to us that Mr. Pang
was the one there to watch the watchers, though he turned out to be surprisingly
easy to talk to!

#### Pyongyang

We had some downtime before the other half of the tour joined us via the train, so we drove
around Pyongyang for a bit. At first glance, the city is not that different from many
in China. There are some new and glassy buildings, but by and large, it's on the bleaker
side, with gray and brown buildings punctuated by colorful commercial signs. The taxis even
looked exactly like the ones in Beijing, and we also saw a couple of BMWs.

Of course, every once and awhile there was a reminder that this was not China, but a country
with a strong personality cult:

But honestly the similarities outweighed the differences. From some photos and descriptions
on the internet, I had expected an eerily quiet and constructed city. But it was actually quite
lively, with plenty of cars on the road and people bicyling around. And there were even some
things that seemed quintessentially Asian, like this opportunity to take cutesy family photos:

Before being joined by our fellow tour members, we also had the chance to check out the
[Pyongyang Arch of Triumph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_of_Triumph_(Pyongyang)),
10 meters taller than the once in France!

#### Talking about Otto Warmbier

While we were waiting in front of the train station, Mr. Kim asked us if we knew about this
college student who was currently detained. We were caught a bit off guard, but answered in the
affirmative. Mr. Kim proceeded to say that there are respectful and disrespectful people from
every country, and hoped that our week would be about only about making happy memories and not
dangerous activities. We of course quickly agreed! 

#### The Hotel

Our group was staying at the
[Yanggakdo Hotel](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294444-d644971-Reviews-Yanggakdo_Hotel-Pyongyang.html),
the largest operational hotel in Pyongyang. (It's greatly dwarfed by the still uncompleted
[Ryugong Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryugyong_Hotel). The hotel is literally located on an
island in the middle of Pyongyang, making it that much more unlikely for foreigners to wander
off in the night.

Again, the hotel was reminiscent of China, with a beautiful lobby and exterior, but rooms that
felt lacking relative to Western standards (exposed piping, improper drainage, etc). It did
boast a bevy of services: several restaurants, dry cleaning, billiards, karaoke, massage parlor,
salon, etc. More about some of these things later. Here's quick shot of the lobby, better pictures
are easily found via Google:

That night we had dinner in the hotel. It started great, with small Korean dishes,
but then oddly drifted
to breaded cutlets and spaghetti. Thankfully, this was the most Western meal of the trip.
Also, there was free beer with dinner, as there would be with every lunch and dinner
from here on out...

Most of the group ended the night by enjoying the amenities. Aaron and I wandered around a bit
between karaoke and billiards before turning in early given our continued time difference struggle
and the long day ahead. Next up: the DMZ!

This begins a series of (retroactive) blog posts recounting my spring break 2014 trip to Iceland
with Aaron Roper. Though Aaron was an experienced traveler, this trip represented my first
self-planned journey, and kicked off three years of increasingly interesting spring break trips!

These posts are a collection of funny stories and happenings from the trip, and less a true
travel journal recounting the details of every city, waterfall, and mountain.

###Introduction

I honestly don't remember where the initial idea of going to Iceland came from, or even when Aaron
and I decided to travel together. At the time, it seemed like an adventurous travel destination
off the beaten path. Though hindsight reveals that this is not the case, as I have realized
first that Iceland is a popular travel destination for Westerners, and second increased the bar for
an "adventurous destination."

Broadly, we set out to drive the entirety of Iceland's famous
[Route 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_1_(Iceland)), often termed the "Ring Road"
as it (unsurprisingly) rings the island. As will become apparent through these blog posts,
this was perhaps ill-advised, though made for some wonderful stories...

###Day 1: Departure and Day in Reykyavik

After a scrumptious dining hall dinner, we left for Boston Logan, looking forward to a red-eye
flight that would arrive in the wee hours of the morning in Reykyavik. Unfortunately, we both barely
slept...and arrived in the city incredibly tired but excited for a full day of sightseeing!

We first picked up what was to become the one constant in our lives in the next week, our trusty
vehicle:

(This photo is from later in the trip).
We were trying to travel on the cheap, and as such rented the smallest, cheapest possible car...
a decision that we would later come to regret.

After driving into Reykyavik, we quickly saw the Icelandic equivalents of the Capitol, National
Mall, Times Square, and St. Paul's Cathedral...all in less than five minutes. Combined with our
exhaustion and an unfortunate rain, we asked each other and ourselves why we had come to this
strange and foreign country.

Next came the (in)famous [Icelandic Phallological Museum](http://www.phallus.is/en/), some photos
of which are below:

Aaron was thankfully just the requisite age to rent a vehicle in Iceland, and able to
drive a stick-shift (both characteristics I did not possess). Unfortunately, the last time
he had driven was in New Zealand, leading to a wonderful rush of adrenaline in the middle of the day
when we drove in the wrong lane!

For dinner, we went to a tiny seafood restaurant recommended by our trusty Frommer's guidebook,
where we saw whale fillets amongst normal seafoods and Aaron bravely tried putrefied shark.

At the end of the night, We contemplated going out to appreciate Reykyavik's nightlife...but
instead collapsed at our hostel and slept for 12 hours straight.

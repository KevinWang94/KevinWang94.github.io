### Intro

First of the Stans we were visiting, Kazakhstan is Central Asia's largest
country, and should be known for much more than just Borat. Unfortunately,
[that hasn't always been the case](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-17491344).
This is also where our guided tour through Steppe Journeys began.

We flew from Kiev to Almaty, Kazakhstan, arriving at 1AM Kiev time or 4AM
Almaty time. Not sure why Ukraine Air has such weird flight schedules...
After a brief mix-up at the airport, we found our guide Zakir and driver Slava,
and went to our hotel for a quick nap before sightseeing!

### Sights

First up was the
[Medeu Ice Rink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medeu),
a huge rink that's part of a larger winter
sports complex outside of Almaty. It was used in 2011 to host the Winter
Asian Games, and also would have been used for the 2022 Winter Olympics had
Almaty's bid won out over Beijing's.
We also (somewhat foolishly) decided to hike up this steep structure behind
the rink that was built to stop mudslides. The view from the top was beautiful
though!

I also discovered here that our driver had been given a Burton sticker by some
traveler, yay Vermont!

Next was [Kok-tobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kok_Tobe),
a recreation area atop another hill close to the city,
accessible by cable car. The top had everything: kids rides, petting zoo,
climbing wall, etc. It apparently also has the only statue in the world of
all four Beatles, built recently due to local fans:

While on the cable car, we were able to glimpse some
villas pointed out by our guide Zakir. As in many other countries, the influx
of natural resource wealth has created a new upper class eager to display
their status. Indeed, I saw a ridiculous number of Bentleys and Mercedes
S-classes while in Almaty...

It was at the Central State Museum that I began to grasp the incredibly
complex history of this region. Due to its location on the Silk Road and general
centrality in Eurasia, it has been settled by a huge variety of peoples
and religions, including Russians, Persians, Mongols, and Macedonians.
This history can still
be seen while walking around today, with what I perceived to be a wide variety of
appearances, from folks who I swore were Chinese to people with very European
features. The story of religion is similar. At various times,
Paganism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam
have all been practiced in the
region. The last is currently the most prevalent, though apparently the region is
known for a more relaxed practice. We saw very few women with hijabs, and all
the restaurants we frequented seemed quite popular despite it being Ramadan.
Though, our guide did mention that fewer and fewer people in the area drink
now, possibly due to a recent surge of Muslim practice.

Finally, we wandered around a National Mall-esque area in the city center,
with statues honoring national heros as well as important contemporary
buildings. Highlights included the
[Ascension Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascension_Cathedral,_Almaty)
which was constructed entirely out of wood (even the nails):

Though we would return to fly out of Almaty, this was our last and only day
really doing anything in Kazakhstan. Up next: Kyrgyzstan!

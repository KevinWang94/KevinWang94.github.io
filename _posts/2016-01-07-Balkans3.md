###Day 3: Dubrovnik

We started the morning with a bus to Dubrovnik, our first border crossing (into Croatia).
Dubrovnik has a beautiful old city that's largely built of stone with famous city walls. In the
heyday of Italian city states, it rivaled Venice for supremacy of the Adriatic.
Of course, given our modern sense of scale, we quickly realized that we could walk across the entire
walled city in no time. It was by far the most touristy of the areas we visited, and during our time
there we saw several Asian tour groups, which of course meant selfie sticks!

After checking into our Airbnb, we visited several local religious institutions: a Dominican Monastery,
a Catholic Church, Serbian Church (Orthodox), and Jewish Synagogue. This sort of religious diversity
was common in the cities we visited.

At sunset, we went to [Cafe Buza](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295371-d552668-Reviews-Cafe_Buza-Dubrovnik_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html),
a bar that's cut into the cliffs of the city.

We then hit a seafood place for dinner and a bar for drinks. A pretty relaxed day!

###Day 4: Dubrovnik

This was our primary sightseeing day in beautiful Dubrovnik. We had planned for two days and two
nights in Dubrovnik, a real luxury as the rest of the trip was more fast-paced. We started the day
by walking around the city walls which were stunning. You get a great view of the city from all
different angles. While we were walking around we also ran into a movie set, so that was exciting.
Didn't get the name of the movie being filmed though... If you see me in the background if anything
in theaters - let me know!

Next came the cable car to Mt. Srd, where we got more beautiful views of the old town, as well as a
fort that had been turned into a museum. It was where Croatians held high ground during the Serbian
siege of the city, and contained highly partisan descriptions of the conflict.

We then hit the beach, further evidence that this was our relaxing day. There, we also
found this wonderful sign:

Our first two choices for dinner were closed, so we ended up at a romantic restaurant overlooking
the walls. The higher prices forced us to cut back to just one glass of wine apiece - a true travesty!
We then made the terrible climb up to our Airbnb (it really was tough going as the old city is quite
hilly, especially at the end of a long day).

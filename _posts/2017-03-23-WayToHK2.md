### Day 1: Arrival in Morocco

My flight was a direct red-eye from JFK to Casablanca aboard a 787.  As a recent devoted
reader of
[One Mile at a Time](http://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/),
I almost feel obligated to write a trip report, but the flight was largely uneventful
aside from the aloof French lady who had just presumptuosly sat in my seat and couldn't
figure out how to work the tray table for the entire duration of the flight.

From there, it was a relatively easy train journey to Marrakech and a cab ride
from the train station to vicinity of our hostel.
The driver actually used the meter,
took a direct route, and the ride was only $2! Fingers crossed that this taxi
luck sticks around. We were staying in a beautiful
[riad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_riad)
in Marrakech's [medina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina_quarter).
Though it had a lot of charm, it was also located down ridiculously confusing and twisting
streets. Thankfully, some nice shopkeeper took pity on me in my confused foreigner state
and led me there. The hostel itself was quite nice, here's a picture from Tripadvisor of
the courtyard:

Albert and I were hoping to do a three day tour from Marrakech the next day that
would eventually get to the
[Erg Chebbi sand dunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erg_Chebbi)
in the Sahara. They're the largest dunes in Morocco, supposedly going up to 150m in
height. We had thought about booking this ahead of time, but heard that it was both easier
and cheaper to find something locally upon arrival. So I asked the lady at our hostel,
who after some false starts, summoned a guy who would've fit right in on the Jersey Shore,
complete with slicked back hair and bling.  He advertised a relatively standard itinerary,
which included the all-important camel trekking and a night in the desert. After some
negotiation, I was able to talk the price down to 700
[Moroccan dirhams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_dirham)
which is around $70. For three days with breakfast and dinner included, it seemed like a
great deal to me. And though it was all arranged at the last minute, I was hopeful that
things would go well the following day...

#### Marrakech First Impressions

After dinner, I went exploring in the
[souq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souq), which was about as I expected.
Around the [Jemaa el-Fnaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemaa_el-Fnaa)
(the central square) it's mostly shops selling tourist knick-knacks that are constantly
harassing you. Interestingly, it seems like Japanese tourists are much more common than
Chinese ones in this area, as I got way more konichiwa's than nihao's.  The souq really
reminded me of Istanbul's Sultanahmet area, and it was also similar in how quickly the
touristy part gave way to areas used for commerce by locals. Just walking a little
further out than the average tourist landed you around boring-looking shops that sold
kitchenware and vegetables.

Finally, Albert arrived to Marrakech from Fez late in the evening, and we
prepared ourselves for a very early morning departure for our desert tour!

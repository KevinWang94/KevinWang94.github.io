### Day 1: Arrival

My flight was a direct red-eye from JFK to Casablanca aboard a 787.
As a recent devoted reader of
[One Mile at a Time](http://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/)
I almost feel obligated to write a trip report, but the flight was honestly
largely uneventful, aside from the aloof French lady who had just
presumptuosly sad in my seat.

From there, it was a relatively easy train journey to Marrakech and a cab ride
from the train station to vicinity of our hostel.
The driver actually used the meter,
took a direct route, and the ride was only $2! Fingers crossed that this taxi
luck sticks around. We were staying in a
[riad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_riad)
in Marrakech's [medina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina_quarter).
Though it
had a lot of charm, it was also located down ridiculously confusing twisting
streets. Thankfully, some nice shopkeeper took pity on my confused foreigner
state and led me there. The hostel itself was quite nice, here's a picture I
stole from their [website](http://www.dartamlil.com/photorama.php):

Albert and I were hoping to do a three day tour from Marrakech the next day that
would eventually get to the
[Erg Chebbi sand dunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erg_Chebbi)
in the Sahara. They're the largest dunes in Morocco, supposedly going up to
150m in height! We had thought
about booking this ahead of time, but heard that it was both easier and cheaper
to find something locally upon arrival. So we asked the lady at our hostel, who
after some false starts, summoned a guy who would've fit in at the Jersey
Shore, complete with slicked back hair and blind.
He advertised a relatively standard itinerary, which included the
all-important camel trekking and a night in the desert. After some negotiation,
I was able to talk the price down to 700
[Moroccan dirhams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_dirham)
which is $70. For three days with breakfast and dinner included, it seemed
like a great deal to me. And though it was all arranged at the last minute,
I was hopeful that things would go well the following day...

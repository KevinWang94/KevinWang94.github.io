### Day 3: A Day of Contrasts

#### Kumsusan Palace of the Sun

We began the day at the mausoleum for Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, a massive
complex built for Kim Il Sung during his life, and then converted into a resting
place for first him and then his son. It was hands-down the strangest place
we visited all week.

Before going, we had been given strict guidelines about this day, mostly about
"looking smart," e.g. no jeans, hoodies, etc. The guides ended up being a bit laxer
than I expected, so I wore just a sweater over a collared shirt. All the North
Koreans we saw visiting wore complete suits though, with many women wearing the
traditional Korean dress. 

Upon entering the complex, everyone was subjected to a security search, and then
we were sent along a long set of moving walkways and escalators with patriotic
music playing and smiling pictures of the leaders. In this area, we were asked
to keep our hands at our sides and not talk or laugh. It seems that this part
of the complex was specifically designed to create feelings of solemnity and
grandeur.

We then stepped into the mausoleum area itself, a beautifully palatial building
with floor to ceiling marble. I've read that the renovations to this building
cost at least $100 million and perhaps several times more, occurring around the
same time as the North Korean Famine.

We also walked through several rooms that contained medals, awards, and honorary
doctorates given to the Kims by other nations. We even saw a medal from the
United States! In actuality, it seemed to be a commemorative medallion from
Bill Clinton's inagauration that I imagine you can pick up on eBay...

Then came the main event, visiting the leaders. Kim Il Sun and Kim Jong Il
each have their own rooms where their bodies lie in state: a central
glass coffin in a darkened room with reddish lighting. We're asked to make rows
of four, with each row entering the room and bowing thrice: at his feet, left, and
right sides. As you might imagine, this was quite surreal.

Before exiting the complex, we also saw the ships and train carriages used
by the Kims, which evidently were surrounded by marble at great expense.
We even saw a MacBook on the desk of Kim Jong Il! We weren't able to take
pictures within the building, but here's one shot of me on the outside of the
complex:

#### Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetary and Mansu Grand Hill Monument

Next was the Martyrs' Cemetary, which memorializes certain Koreans who lost
their lives resisting the Japanese. It's clear that some of these martyrs
have entered the national mythos, with one of our guides telling us a story
about a martyr cutting out his own tongue while a POW to avoid spilling
any secrets.

Finally before lunch we stopped at the great statues of the dear leaders
on Mansudae, two 22 meter bronze works (in comparison, the statue at the
Lincoln Memorial is roughly 6 meters tall). Here again, our group arranged
ourselves and bowed to the leaders. We were also cautioned to include
the whole bodies of both leaders in our pictures of the monuments out
of respect. Here's a photo of a wedding party that came through while
we were there, one of around twenty (no one seemed to know why there
were so many)!

#### Pub Crawl

After a solemn morning came the St. Patrick's Day pub crawl! A day of contrasts
indeed. The details of the pubs themselves aren't too important, but many
brewed their own (very cheap) beer which was quite good.

We were also able to stop by a department store, where nearly all the goods
seemed to come from China. Albert and I did pick up some "Capri Sonne" which
tasted pretty good, as well as a Korean knock-off of White Rabbit candy:

Also, a trip to a shooting range was added to the itinerary...after we had
already had our first pub crawl stop. Thankfully, no one was injured, and
I actually hit some of the targets! My first time ever shooting a gun, I'll
take it:

And someone else on the tour even paid extra to shoot at a pheasant which
I think was given to our driver in the end. 

#### Dinner and Haircut

At dinner, our guides and the local waitresses treated us to karaoke
performances, with some of the more inebriated members of the party
getting up to dance. I snuck in a couple of videos, they're fantastic.

Back at the hotel, I was able to get my haircut in North Korea! Sadly
they didn't have the infamous approved haircuts sign or anything, so I
just got my hair cut generically shorter. He's a picture taken by our guide
Mr. Pang who helpfully stuck around to translate:

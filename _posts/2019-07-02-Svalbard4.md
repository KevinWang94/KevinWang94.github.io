### Day 3: Summer Adventure on a Snowmobile

Our main activity this day was Better Moments' 
[Summer Adventure on a Snowmobile](https://www.bettermoments.no/portfolio/summer-adventure-on-a-snowmobile/),
which included a hike up to the glacier and some snowmobiling on it! The tour company seemed like a 
more serious operation than Svalbard Wildlife Expeditions. Their office was very serious and hunting-lodge-esque, and
they didn't charge us for renting shoes, which I believe were actually waterproof this time! 
Though, note that this tour was almost twice the price for about half the time... We were also each 
issued ski goggles and a helmet for snowmobiling. Our guide was also just generally more conservative/responsible, ensuring that
we stayed together during the hike, asking us to walk single file through the slushy snow, etc. 
I appreciated this, but I think everyone else wished she was a bit free-er. 

We actually left from basically the same spot as the previous day's hike, but then veered right instead of
left, ending up on a different glacier. Thankfully, this also meant going over streams with makeshift
bridges, so no wet shoes!

The hike up was pretty similar to the day before, some scrambling over loose 
rocks (the sliding around was not fun with blisters) giving way to slushy snow conditions
before firmer snow on the glacier-proper. 
My hiking boots were about ankle high which was low enough that snow keep getting into them.
I regret not having picked up some gaiters, which I think they had on offer at the lodge.
Would definitely recommend having some if you're hiking through any sort of snow.

Eventually, we made it to where the snowmobiles were parked. They just leave them there all summer along
with a bunch of gasoline, as there's no snow-covered route back to town.

We actually saw a lot of snowmobiles
haphazardly parked on gravel or pallets around Longyearbyen, dormant until the winter I guess.
Strangely, there are actually no roads between
the various towns on the island, so in the summer when snowmobiling doesn't work, your only options are 
traveling by boat (like what we took to Pyramiden) or helicopter. 

None of us had snowmobiled before, but I think we all had a great time, even Daniel who wasn't able to drive
due to having an expired driver's license. We basically just drove in a straight line up the glacier, so
it was pretty easy to get the hang of. The snowmobile even had aggressively heated handlebars which 
most of us ended up turning off. I imagine they're a godsend in the winter. I did have a bit of a dicey
moment at the very top, where I ended up turning wider than I should have with a bit of a drop-off on 
one side. The guide told me she was a bit worried, she and emphasized no more "James Bond maneuvers" for the 
way down. We stopped at the top for lunch, and Michal and Dore (the youngest and oldest members of the 
group, respectively) had a little snowball fight:

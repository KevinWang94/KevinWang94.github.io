I recently stumbled upon [BookTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BookTube), specifically
[a video](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30211956-books-for-living) which mentioned the idea of a
"100 Book Bookshelf" from Will Schwalbe's [*Books for Life*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30211956-books-for-living).
Like the creator of the video, I wasn't able to come up with a list of 100 books, though unlike him I'm not 
sad about that. I've come up with "25," in quotes because there are some bonuses and "ties."
I really enjoyed putting this together and decided to post it here, partially so I can easily share with friends
and ask them to produce lists too. 
We all have a bit more time to read these days...

I've sorted the list into sections based on their genre, and roughly ordered them by when I read them.
I had a lot to say about some but not all of the books, which is at best loosely correlated with how
strongly I would recommend them? But given that they're on this list, I would still definitely recommend all of them. 
Books made this list for a variety of reasons. Some taught me something special, or
changed my view of the world in a particular way. Others just spoke to me for some reason, or caused a strong
emotional reaction. A lot of the non-fiction books are on this list because they were the first to expose me
to a particular novel idea. I make no claims about whether they hold up / are the best presentation of
that idea. So without further ado, my 25 book bookshelf. Everything has
Goodreads links. Everyone should join Goodreads.

### Fiction

#### [*All the Light You Cannot See*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18143977-all-the-light-we-cannot-see)

This book has both a wonderful story and beautiful prose. Aside from the below childhood favorites, it's also the 
earliest-read fiction book on this list, which is a little sad because I read it in 2016. Making this list 
made me realize just how little fiction I read in college and the years after. The remaining fiction books
were all ready between 2018 and 2020.

#### [*In a Strange Room*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7199961-in-a-strange-room)

As people may know, I love to travel, and this is a book about travel that I mostly read at an airport. (Though sadly,
the trip wasn't to somewhere epic but rather Vermont for my sister's HS graduation). It's written in a beautiful
melancholy tone, which tends to work for me. (Other authors I think write in this style are 
[Elizabeth Strout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Strout) and 
[Julian Barnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Barnes)).
For further description, I'll shamelessly quote the Man Booker Prize, who 
[shortlisted](https://thebookerprizes.com/books/strange-room-by-damon-galgut)
the book in 2010: "A novel of longing and thwarted desire, rage and compassion, *In a Strange Room* is the hauntingly beautiful evocation of one manâ€™s search for love and for a place to call home."

#### [*A Gentleman in Moscow*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34066798-a-gentleman-in-moscow)

This book has my favorite story/plot of all the books on this list. 
It's strongly connected in my head with Wes Anderson's 
*Grand Budapest Hotel*, and a quick Google search just now shows that I'm not the first person to have made 
the connection. 
In fact, the author himself [realized the parallels](https://www.goodreads.com/questions/832572-have-you-seen-the-grand-budapest-hotel-by).
I also found lots of reviews / publisher copy describing the book as *War and Peace* meets *Downton Abbey* meets *The Grand Budapest Hotel*...make of that what you will. 

#### [	*Free Food for Millionaires*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40727626-free-food-for-millionaires)

I first heard about author 
[Min Jin Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Jin_Lee) for her book *Pachinko*, which I think become a phenomenon of sorts. I requested both
of her books from the library, and this one happened to arrive first. I'm not sure how much that has to do with my belief
that this is the better book (nothing against *Pachinko*, I also rated that five stars). Perhaps it's because
I could identify more easily with the main character, who is the child of immigrants living in New York City? Casey and I 
are obviously different in many ways, but I saw some of myself in her, and reading this book caused me to reflect on
and confront parts of my self-image in a way that no other book has. 

#### [*On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41880609-on-earth-we-re-briefly-gorgeous)

This is the debut novel of 
[Ocean Vuong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Vuong). He first received acclaim for his poetry, and 
the novel certainly reads that way. It has the most creative and beautiful prose of all the books I've read, 
resulting in me highlighting an absurd percentage of the book when reading it. I transcribed
some of my favorite quotes, two of which are below (no spoilers, I think):

> In a world myriad as ours, the gaze is a singular act: to look at something is to fill your whole life with it, if only briefly.

> It's in these moments, next to you, that I envy words for doing what we can never do&mdash;how they can tell all of themselves simply by standing still, simply by being. Imagine I could lie down beside you and my whole body, every cell, radiates a clear, singular meaning, not so much writer as a word pressed down beside you.  

#### [*The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24885533-the-paper-menagerie-and-other-stories)

I've recently enjoyed a number of sci-fi short story collections, and this one was my favorite of 
the bunch. The title story in particular is stunning.

#### [*A Little Life*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22822858-a-little-life)

This is the most recently read book from this whole list, as I finished it during my first weekend of aggressive
social distancing. The book is just a lot. First of all, it's over 700 pages, which makes it one of the longest
books I've ever read. It's in fact good for second longest amongst "serious fiction" books.
But more importantly, it's crushingly crushingly sad. I've never had a book emotionally wreck me like 
this one. I had to put it down multiple times just because of how painful it was to read. But I was 
so invested in the characters and the writing that I picked it up again every time. 
And yes, I cried, a lot. 
Worth noting that the book has had a lot of strong/mixed reactions that I won't try to summarize here (watch 
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXq84DL68Hc) for a take *with spoilers* I agree with). 
Finally, this book has basically every trigger warning ever. You have been warned.

### Non-Fiction

#### [*Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1202.Freakonomics)
#### [*Outliers: The Story of Success*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3228917-outliers)

I'm going to describe these together because I read them both when I was pretty young (13ish), and in hindsight
I like them for the same reason. They both describe a number of cases where the world behaves
in an interesting and unintuitive way, which at the time was revelatory. 
Would I find the books groundbreaking if I read them now? Probably not. Does 
Malcolm Gladwell deserve the criticism he receives for oversimplification? Probably. But I still really treasure
these books.

#### [*The American Pageant: A History of the Republic*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1210774.The_American_Pageant)

A history textbook? Yes, a history textbook. I credit this book and the associated class in high school for solidifying my love of history. 
I liked it so much that I bought my own personal copy. 
It's written in a surprisingly engaging and colloquial style, with many sections having
delightful names that I stlil remember to this day, like
"Rockefeller Grows the American Beauty Rose."

An honorable mention goes to [*The Pilgrimage of Western Man*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1222158.The_Pilgrimage_of_Western_Man), which I think is 
sadly out of print. We read many chapters from this in AP Euro, with "The Two Christendoms" (about the Thirty Years War) being a particular favorite. 
And yes, I also own a personal copy of this.

#### [*Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1842.Guns_Germs_and_Steel)

History is often taught to children as the story of people, of great individual leaders and societies that won or lost. 
This book really upended that view of the world for me. It's probably the book that altered my view of history and 
society the most. It advances a structuralist narrative for the "fates of human societies,"
claiming that environmental factors like geography and climate have really been responsible for the arc of human history.
I know Jared Diamond and this book are somewhat controversial in academic circles, and I suspect it might not "hold up" for me upon re-reading,
but I'll always treasure it because of how influential it was to high-school me. You might also recall that another one
of his books, *Collapse*, partially inspired my trip to 
[Easter Island]({{/travel/2017/11/08/EasterIsland1.html | prepend: site.baseurl}}).

#### [The Rape of Nanking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95784.The_Rape_of_Nanking)
#### [We Wish to Inform You that Tomorrow We Will be Killed With Our Families](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11472.We_Wish_to_Inform_You_That_Tomorrow_We_Will_Be_Killed_with_Our_Families)
Two tremendously sad history books about the lowest that humanity at large can go.

#### [*Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12031563-coming-apart)

This is a book about how America, specifically white America, is coming apart at the seams of class. 
It discusses how a certain set of people are increasingly good at going to the same schools, working in the 
same lucrative industries, and living in the same areas. And of course, they marry each other and have privileged
children, intensifying
the cycle. It does a great job of comprehensively presenting the trends that have led to the differences between
the proverbial "Fishtown" and Belmont." For a longer summary, please see [this piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/31/opinion/brooks-the-great-divorce.html)
by David Brooks. 
I read it in 2015, and it's been really influential in shaping my understanding of modern day American society, and specifically
the rise of a figure like Donald Trump (more on him later in this list).
If you're reading this and have talked to me with any regularity since 2015, there's a decent chance I made
you take [this quiz](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/do-you-live-in-a-bubble-a-quiz-2) that's pulled
from the book.

I feel obligated to mention that Murray is a rather 
[controversial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve#Criticisms) 
[figure](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/middlebury-free-speech-violence/518667/), 
and I don't intend to endorse him more broadly than recommending this individual work. The book itself is careful to sidestep
partisanship as much as possible. I think it pulls themes from both the Left and the Right, and 
it purposely avoids prescriptive solutions for the problems described, at least until a small bit at the end.
Amusingly, I had lunch with Niall Ferguson my senior spring because I was taking a class of his, and he
was pleasantly surprised that someone from our liberal elitist hotbed would recommend a book by Charles Murray. 
This was of course his last semester at Harvard before decamping to the conservative Hoover Institute.

#### [*Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25852784-evicted)

This book does a tremendous job of describing the myriad of reasons, small and large, that make life in poverty difficult
in America. Through the lens of eviction, it really drove home for me how precarious life is for many. 
The book is probably going to be unfortunately topical for a while now (the events described are from the last recession). 

#### [*Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28695425-strangers-in-their-own-land)

Both before and after the 2016 election, a lot of attention was devoted to "Trump's America," the white working
class Americans supposedly key to his election. A quick Google search will turn up hundreds of articles
in major publications profiling these people, reacting to other profiles, and of course meta-discussing this general
[media obsession](https://theweek.com/articles/745394/media-blinded-by-obsession-rural-white-trump-voters). 
Amongst all of this media, this book was the most successful for me in "explaining" this part of our country.
I think it does a great job of weaving a narrative that animates this part of the country, and being sympathetic
while also pointing out contradictions. There's a particularly evocative metaphor about 
[a brown pelican cutting in line](https://www.thecut.com/2016/11/sociology-of-trump-country.html) 
that has stayed with me. That the book succeeds on these fronts is perhaps unsurprising
given that it was written by an esteemed sociologist who took the time to seriously research and understand these people.
It's lucky for her that the end of this project coincided with the 2016 election...or at least for her sales numbers?
This is the book that I think many poeple wanted when they read
[*Hillbilly Elegy*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27161156-hillbilly-elegy), at least 
it was for me. And nothing against
that book, it's just much more of a personal memoir than an attempt at a explanatory narrative. 

#### [*The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11324722-the-righteous-mind)

I've unfortunately forgotten many of the details of this book and should probably read it again. But
some of its larger points about the interactions between morality and intuition have really stuck with me.

#### [*Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18406408-please-stop-helping-us)

I don't necessarily endorse the positions taken by this book, but I found it a very interesting read. 
Unsurprisingly, it talks about the consequences of mainstream liberal policies and their 
negative effects on black America. For example, it posits that minimum wage laws disproportionately disadvantage poor
black Americans because they're the ones who most need the eliminated "stepping-stone" jobs.
[*The Enigma of Clarence Thomas*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36595606-the-enigma-of-clarence-thomas) is 
another interesting book in a similar vein.

#### [*Too Big to Fail*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6687247-too-big-to-fail)

A surprising thrilling narrative of the 2008 Financial Crisis that does a good job of explaining
the complexities of the situation in an easily digestible way.


### Autobiography

#### [*Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1848.Wild_Swans)

This is my go-to recommendation for understanding China's history in the 20th century. It's like a non-fiction
*Pachinko*, following the three generations of Chinese women that end with the author herself.

#### [*My Beloved World*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13642929-my-beloved-world)

Justice Sonia Sotomayor has unsurprisingly received a lot of attention for her identity as the first latina 
on the Supreme Court as well as her opinions on issues such as affirmative action. (For example, see her dissent
in [*Schuette v. BAMN*](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2014/04/sotomayor-epic-affirmative-action-ban-dissent.html)
and associated coverage). This book gives the reader some insight into her background, and how it's shaped her 
jurisprudence. And in my opinion, her life story overall is a powerful argument in favor of affirmative action.

#### [*The World as It Is: Inside the Obama White House*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38458392-the-world-as-it-is)

There have already been [a lot](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/us/politics/obama-white-house-memoirs.html)
of memoirs about Obama's two terms in office, and I suspect more are coming. I've only read a couple, but this one really 
spoke to me. It captures all the good things I want to believe about government and what it can do. 
Think of it as a real-life *West Wing*. 

### "Self-Help"

#### [*Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8520610-quiet)

Describing this book as "self-help" is a little weird. But I've placed it here because reading it
helped me realize some things about myself and introvertedness, which have overall made me a better
and happier person.

#### [*So Good They Can't Ignore You*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13525945-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you)

#### [*The Defining Decade*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13523061-the-defining-decade)

I read both of these during senior spring, while I was trying to come to terms with being "an adult" and 
all that fun stuff. Both of these books really helped shaped my thinking during that period. 
I should probably give the second one another read, now that I'm \*gasp\* more than halfway through my 20s.

### Childhood Favorites

It didn't seem right to include these above in the fiction section, so I'm putting them here in their own.
I'm not sure this section really serves a purpose, other than indulging my own nostalgia. I also realized
how many children's series I aged out of before they could finish being published, which is quite unfortunate.

#### [*The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6671.The_Wonderful_Story_of_Henry_Sugar_and_Six_More)

Roald Dahl was my favorite author for a couple of years in elementary school, and this is the book I recall
loving the most. If you haven't read his adult fiction, I would heartily recommend. Much of it is sick and twisted in the 
way that his children's books obviously are in hindsight.

#### [*Redwall*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7996.Redwall)

Who would've thought that a bunch of rodents at an abbey would be so exciting? Or that I would happily read 17
books with basically the same plot before I got bored of them? (I read them in publication order, and stopped at
*Rakkety Tam*).

#### [*Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1.Harry_Potter_and_the_Half_Blood_Prince)

I resisted reading Harry Potter for a while, and then finally binged the first four books in five days in third grade. 
I think this and the fifth book are the two books I've read the most in my life, due to having them during some
boring trips to China.

#### [*Ender's Game*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game)

Orson Scott Card is probably the author whose books I've read the most of, between the Ender series, Alvin Maker, and
miscellaneous others. I reread *Ender's Game* one night in college and was surprised at how much it held up, though it's hard
separate the nostalgia from that opinion.

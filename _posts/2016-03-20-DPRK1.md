This begins a series of blog posts about my spring break 2016 trip to the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea with Aaron Roper (stopping for a couple days in Beijing en route).
Though it would've been nice to blog along the way, the DPRK of course doesn't have internet,
so I'm writing these after returning back to Boston.


### Introduction

After [Iceland]({{ "/tags/iceland.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and
[the Balkans]({{ "/tags/balkans.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}),
we obviously had to up the craziness for the
third and final installment of our spring break travel, so we settled on North Korea! 
I realize this choice is...unorthodox so thie first post is dedicated mostly to explaining
first myself and then the mechanics of getting there.

### Why North Korea

First, please see
[my previous post]({ post_url 2016-01-20-TravelPhilosophy })
about traveling philosophy for a general sense of why I go to countries that are a bit
unorthodox.

Specific to this trip, there are just so many reasons to visit the DPRK. At the end of the day,
it's a country that's thought of in the West as absolutely mystical and crazy, and given that
I had the chance to check it out, I jumped on it. Some more specific things that I find personally
compelling:

+In a world that's increasingly globalized and connected, the average North Korean citizen
doesn't have internet access, or McDonald's, or Coca Cola. And in fact, they're propagandized
to daily and entirely reliant on their state for views of other peoples and nations.
+With the fall of the Soviet Union and the increasing openness of China and Cuba, it's one of the few
(and perhaps the only) authoriarian socialist regime left.
+It's a country that promotes itself as being actively hostile to the US, and was part of
Beorge W. Bush's "Axis of Evil" with Iraq and Iran.
+It's one of the few place where US citizens must be supervised by local guides. Two others,
Turkmenistan and Iran, are pretty high on my list too.
+ This pictures:

+It's probably the closest I'm able to get to the China of my parents' youth.

Of course not exhaustive, if you search around for other travel blogs, there are a million
great reasons out there for visiting. 

### Mechanics of Getting There
It's actually relatively easy for most foreign tourists to visit the country, you 
just have to go through a tour group that partners with the official North Korean
tour company, the KITC (they watch you like a hawk when you're there...more on that
later). It's also 100% legal according to US law
to visit their for normal tourism, unlike, for example, Cuba.
As U.S. citizens, we were required to fly first into Beijing, and from Beijing to Pyongyang via 
Air Koryo, the DPRK's national airline.
But citizens from other countries are able to take a 24-hour train ride from Beijing.
We personally went with
[Young Pioneer Tours](http://www.youngpioneertours.com/) on their St. Patrick's Day
themed tour. We're of course not Irish or anything, the dates just worked out with our
Spring Break.

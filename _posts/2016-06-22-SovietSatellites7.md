### Intro

Our last Soviet Satellite was Moldova, added at the last minute due to our
Turkmenistan visas falling through. We were mostly in Moldova for the chance
to visit [Transnistria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnistria),
a breakaway state that has been described as
"a veritable supermarket of drugs, girls and weapons." 

Unfortunately, flying from Tashkent to Chisinau (the capital of Moldova)
was a real pain, requiring a crazy early flight from Tashkent to Moscow,
14 hours in Moscow Airport, and then a crazy late flight from Moscow to
Chisinau. Thankfully, we survived the ordeal, and Aeroflot didn't lose
our bags, yay! Also, we realized just how spoiled we'd been in Central
Asia: suddenly paying more than a dollar for bottled water seemed ridiculously
expensive. Upon arrival, we checked into our wonderfully Soviet hotel,
slightly apprehensive but excited for the next day.

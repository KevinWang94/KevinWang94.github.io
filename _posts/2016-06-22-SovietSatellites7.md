### Intro

Our last Soviet Satellite was Moldova, added at the last minute due to our
Turkmenistan visas falling through. We were mostly in Moldova for the chance
to visit [Transnistria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnistria),
a breakaway state that has been described as
"a veritable supermarket of drugs, girls, and weapons." We had actually
considered going the year of our [Balkans]({{ "/tags/iceland.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
trip, but were scared away by these sorts of descriptions on the internet
as well as the dire warnings of a Romanian friend. This time, we did more
research, and determined we were probably going to be okay. (Spoiler alert:
we made it out alive).

Unfortunately, flying from Tashkent to
[Chisinau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chisinau) (the capital of Moldova)
was a real pain, requiring a crazy early flight from Tashkent to Moscow,
14 hours in Moscow Airport, and then a crazy late flight from Moscow to
Chisinau. Thankfully, we survived the ordeal, and Aeroflot didn't lose
our bags, yay! Also, we realized just how lucky we'd been in Central
Asia: suddenly paying more than a dollar for bottled water seemed ridiculously
expensive. Upon arrival, we checked into our wonderfully Soviet hotel,
slightly apprehensive but excited for the next day.

### Transnistria!

Getting from Chisinau to Transnistria is actually quite straightforward, with
buses running frequently to Transnistria's capital,
[Tiraspol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiraspol).
We were a bit worried about the border, having heard many stories of
travelers being detained and asked for bribes. As a precaution, we wrote down
a bunch of phrases in Russian such as "No bribes!" as well as the
anti-bribery hotline. Apparently these had been useful for travelers in the
past:

Thankfully, the border going in was no problem, and we were handed
the all important migration card without having to ask for it.
We were even shepherded through by our bus driver who, although not an
English-speaker, realized that two American tourists might put him behind
schedule. He tried to cut the line for us to the outrage of the crowd, but
all was well in the end. We then met our guide Sasha from
[Transnistria Tour](http://transnistria-tour.com/)
and began walking around the city. The sights were honestly not particularly
exciting, a collection of war memorials, monuments, etc. like many other cities.
So I'm going to focus instead here on overall interesting thoughts.
Thanks to Aaron for writing some of the sentences below.

Transnistria as a tourist attraction is advertised as the
"last slice of the USSR," but besides a handful of Lenin statues,
Transnistria could have been anywhere in Eastern Europe. And indeed, we saw
more Lenin statues in Kyrgyzstan and larger ones in Tajikistan.
The main anomaly was the prevalence of Russian (not Soviet) flags and banners
calling for unification with Russia:

Amusingly, there was even a huge billboard of an athletic Putin!

Relations with the US were...complicated. Our guide noted that because of
Russian TV, and general pro-Russian sentiment, people there generally don't like
the US or Americans. However, American cultural hegemony was still on full
display, with our guide's music playlist consisting of almost entirely
American songs, and Disney characters being easily found.

Politically, it's worth noting that unlike any of the four Stans we visited,
Transnistria had a totally peaceful transition of power from a post-Soviet
leader in 2010. While the president is immensely powerful, he does appears
to be democratically accountable. There were no giant photos of him to be seen
(only Putin was worthy of that honor, apparently) and our guide Sasha told us
openly of the president's failed economic plan and 30% pension cuts. These had
apparently made him immensely unpopular, and she assured us that he would lose
handily in the upcoming elections. We certainly didn't hear talk like that in
Uzbekistan! Nationalism was also unexceptional. While our guide referred to
World War II as the Great Patriotic War, the 1992 conflict that secured
Transnistria's unrecognized independence was simply the "Moldovan-Transnistrian 
Conflict." We saw several war memorials to both conflicts, but nothing out of
line with other post-Soviet cities. The Soviets did like their World War II
monuments. Pardon me, Great Patriotic War monuments. Of course, there are
also more light-hearted structures, including this "I <3 Tiraspol" sign:

The only really exceptionally jarring thing was the country's poor economic
health. Our guide described how as a secondary school English teacher she would
be paid a mere $130 per month. Hardly a living wage in a country where prices
seemed to be around half of what we pay in the U.S. For example, the pizza we
had for lunch (at [Andy's Pizza](http://www.andys.md/))
cost $6. See [this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0I404gXbNg)
for more about the frightening economic circumstances. It discusses how many
men in rural villages have sold kidneys in order to make ends meet.
The lack of economic opportunity has caused most of the country's youth
to look elsewhere for employment, with most going to Russia apparently.
And Russia supports Transnistria in other ways as well, providing Russian
citizenship to many citizens as well as free gas to the country. Basically,
given the rough economic circumstances brought about by its strange political
status, support from Russia seems to be the only thing keeping Transnistria
afloat. No wonder so many Transnistrians want to join, even "pleading"
according to the [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26627236).

Given all these hardships, it's unsurprising that many young people don't
have a particularly optimistic view of the future. Talking to Sasha about the
this was definitely the most interesting (and also saddest) part of our
tour, especially given that she's exactly the same age as me.
We asked her where she thought Transnistria would be in 25 years.
At first she laughed that she wouldn't be here in 25 years, so it didn't
matter to her. She was hoping to end up in Germany, or at least Russia.
Then when pressed, she responded that Transnistria would not exist in
25 years. Despite the pro-Russia fervor, reminding us a bit of the relationship
between Kosovo and Albania, she didn't think that union was feasible after
Crimea. But, she also believed that anti-Moldova propaganda would make that reunion
challenging as well. Basically, the overall outlook seems rather grim, with
no future scenarios being both desirable and feasible.

On a happier note, here's a selfie we took with Sasha:

### Exiting Transnistria

Now the hard part, leaving Transnistria. This is largely where other travelers
had been shaken down for bribes. Thankfully, it was surprisingly relaxed, even
more so than entry. We didn't even have to get off the bus!
A guard came through and collected our cards without checking passports and
we were on our way in thirty seconds flat. We had survived Transnistria!

### Chisinau

We ended by wandering around Chisinau, the highlight of which was this
small Occupy-esque encampment, apparently by the
[Dignity and Truth Platform Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity_and_Truth_Platform_Party)
in response to worsening economic conditions and corruption scandals.
I wish we had had more time in Chisinau, but a whole day wandering around
in the Transnistrian heat left me completely exhausted.

### The End

This marks the end of our Sojourn through Soviet Satellite States. For anyone
who actually read this far, thanks for sticking around. From here the traveling
continues, onward to Istanbul and 14 other European countries!

### Intro

Our first country was Ukraine, recently of interest because of its
[conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation)
with Russia in the Crimea, as well as the
[2014 Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Ukrainian_revolution)
which toppled its president. Thankfully, the capital ciy of Kiev is now completely
safe, and where we visited.

### First Night in Kiev

After arriving on an uneventful (albeit cramped) flight from NYC, we checked
into our hostel and wandered around the city. In particular, we saw the
Independence Square where the 2014 Revolution occurred. Of course, the area
now seems largely a commercial shopping center, complete with a McDonald's
at which I ate a "Seasoned American Burger." It was actually quite good,
crunchy tomato & lettuce, BBQ sauce, and higher quality beef than in the US!

While we were at the square, there was also a funeral procession of some
kind by the nationalist [Right Sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Sector).
We weren't quite able to figure
out what was going on, but evidently the deceased was important given the
reverence displayed by the attendees:

Those attendees included this wonderful young gentleman with a fabulous
shirt, "No Knife, No Life!" During the thirty minutes that we observed
the events, he seemed to just mill around the crowd, but never lost
his blank facial expression:

### Chernobyl Day!

This was the exciting day, a day trip to see the Chernobyl area!
It is of course famous for the 1986 nuclear disaster, the worst in human
history.
We went with [Solo East Travel](http://www.tourkiev.com/),
the originator of these tours, and had a wonderful time overall.
Their van proudly advertises trips that "all your friends will be jealous of,"
and trumpets tanks and missiles in addition to Chernobyl:

We got off to an auspicious start,
realizing that our tour group consisted of exactly 13 people. 
Our van set off from Kiev early in the morning, with the ocassional beep
of Geiger counters reminding us of the constant
background radiation that is around us. Along the way, we were shown
various documentaries regarding the events from 1986 and after that were quite interesting.
In particular, I learned first that the botched response by the Soviet authorities to the disaster
resulted in the many unnecessary deaths of nearby residents as well as emergency
personnel. Also, the initial efforts to contain the radiation were made
at great personal risk, with soldiers dropping sandbags by hand from flying
helicopters. There was even one video demonstrating that a flight from
Toronto to Kiev resulted in more absorbed radiation than our trip to
Chernobyl. I'm no radiation expert, but it appears that radiation increases
significantly at high altitudes.
Given that we were going with a government-approved tour group to
sanctioned areas, Aaron and I were generally not concerned about radiation.
Though we had taken the precautions requested by the tour company: wearing
close-toed shoes and long pants and sleeves for the few areas with
elevated radiation. 

After a drive, we arrived at the
[Exclusion Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Exclusion_Zone),
an approximately 1000 square mile area in which
there are almost no permanent residents save a few stubborn grandpas
and grandmas. There are a sizable number of workers within the zone though,
working on various maintenance tasks including the decomissioning of the
reactors as well as the building of a new shield over Reactor Four.
Our guide told us that they make around 1000 Euros per day spent working there.
They had evidently made peace with the radiation exposure, as there were several
employees just chilling right outside of Reactor Four.

Highlights of the day included stops at city signs for Chernobyl and
[Pripyat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pripyat)
as well as visits to several abandoned structures including a school, amusement
park, and garage. They were on the eery side, though honestly no more
than other similarly-abandoned structures.

Here is Aaron and I on the abandoned Ferris Wheel. There was also a neglected
set of bumper cars, an indoor swimming pool with diving platforms, an outdoor
track, etc.

The kindergarten and school were definitely the creepiest. Something about
these dolls just gets me:

### Third Day

Kiev is really a beautiful city, with lots of greenery and a

### Intro

Our first country was Ukraine, recently of interest because of its
[conflict with Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation)
in the Crimea, as well as the
[2014 Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Ukrainian_revolution)
which toppled its president. Thankfully, the capital city of Kiev where we visited
is now completely safe.

### First Night in Kiev

We flew from JFK to Kiev on Ukraine Air, leaving at the bizarre time of 12:30AM EST and
arriving in Kiev around dinner time. I somehow managed to break my glasses on the flight
(yes, the same pair I broke in Iceland), but the flight was otherwise uneventful.
After checking in, we went first to
[Independence Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidan_Nezalezhnosti)
where the 2014 Revolution occurred. Of course, the area
now seems largely a commercial shopping center, complete with a McDonald's
at which I ate a "Seasoned American Burger." It was actually quite good,
crunchy tomato & lettuce, BBQ sauce, and higher quality beef than in the US!

While we were at the square, there was also a funeral procession of some
kind by the nationalist [Right Sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Sector)
party.
We weren't quite able to figure
out what was going on, but evidently the deceased was important given the
reverence displayed by the attendees:

Those attendees included this wonderful young gentleman with a fabulous
shirt, "No Knife, No Life!" During the thirty minutes that we observed
the events, he seemed to just mill around the crowd, but never lost
his blank facial expression:

The event was a reminder that Ukraine is a country embroiled in an active
war, a fact that cannot be missed while walking around Kiev. We passed
several displays regarding the war, mostly walls of young men's photos
commemorating those who had died. Even at Kiev Airport by the gates, there
were these huge photos of soldiers:

### Chernobyl Day!

This was the exciting day, a day trip to see the Chernobyl area!
It is of course famous for the eponymous 1986 nuclear disaster,
the worst in human history.
We went on a day trip with [Solo East Travel](http://www.tourkiev.com/),
the originator of these tours, and had a wonderful time overall.
Their van proudly advertises trips that "all your friends will be jealous of,"
and trumpets tanks and missiles in addition to Chernobyl:

We got off to an auspicious start that morning,
realizing that our tour group consisted of exactly 13 people. 
Our van then set off from Kiev with the ocassional beep
of Geiger counters reminding us of the constant
background radiation that is around us.
Along the way, we were shown various documentaries regarding the events from
1986 and after that were quite interesting. I learned first
that the botched response by the Soviet authorities to the disaster
resulted in many unnecessary deaths of nearby residents as well as emergency
personnel. Also, the initial efforts to contain the radiation were made
at great personal risk, with soldiers dropping sandbags by hand into the reactor
from flying helicopters. There was also one video demonstrating that a flight from
Toronto to Kiev resulted in more absorbed radiation than our trip to
Chernobyl. I'm no radiation expert, but it appears that radiation increases
significantly at high altitudes.
Given that we were going with a government-approved tour group to
sanctioned areas, Aaron and I were generally not concerned about radiation.
Though we had taken the precautions requested by the tour company: wearing
close-toed shoes and long pants and sleeves for the few areas with
elevated radiation. 

After a couple hour drive, we arrived at the
[Exclusion Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Exclusion_Zone),
an approximately 1000 square mile area in which
there are almost no permanent residents save a few stubborn grandpas
and grandmas who have moved back after the disaster.
There are however a sizable number of workers within the zone,
working on various maintenance tasks including the decomissioning of the
site's other three reactors (one of which continued to operate until 2000!)
as well as the building of a new shield over the damaged Reactor 4.
They had evidently made peace with the radiation exposure, as there were several
employees just chilling right outside of the reactor which had some
of the highest radiation numbers of the day. Our guide told us that they
make around 1000 Euros per day spent working there, perhaps that helped?


Highlights of the day included stops at city signs for Chernobyl and
[Pripyat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pripyat)
as well as visits to several abandoned structures including a school, amusement
park, and garage. They were of course on the eery side, though honestly no more
than other similarly-abandoned structures.

Here is Aaron and I on the abandoned Ferris Wheel in Pripyat.
There was also a neglected
set of bumper cars, an indoor swimming pool with diving platforms, an outdoor
track, etc.

The kindergarten and school were definitely the creepiest. Something about
these dolls just gets me:

Walking through these buildings, it was quite clear that some of the rooms
had been carefully arranged since their abrupt abandonment in 1986. 
There were books
purposely opened and dolls stood up. This perfectly done view of a doll
wearing a gas mask was the most egregious:

Of course, we also paid a visit to the damaged Reactor Four. Here it is
in the background, with a Geiger counter showing the radiation to be 3.15
microsieverts, about 20x higher than normal according to our guide.

On our way out of the area, we passed two radiation checkpoints, where we
were asked to stand on these machines which supposedly checked
for contamination. To be honest, I'm not quite sure that they were doing anything,
and everyone around us seemed remarkably casual about them. But, I suppose
it was somewhat comforting? Overall, Chernobyl made for a very interesting
visit and was definitely the highlight of our time in Ukraine.

### Third Day

On our last day in Kiev, we paid a visit to the
[Caves Monastery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev_Pechersk_Lavra),
the city's most popular tourist attraction. We neglected to heed our guidebook's
recommendation about purchasing candles, and ended up stumbling around the dark
caves which are dotted with the glass coffins of various saints. We were also
able to stop by
[St. Sophia's Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Sophia%27s_Cathedral,_Kiev),
which had been closed on the first day when we tried to visit. 

We stopped for lunch at Spotykach, where we mistakenly ordered the cheapest wine
on the menu. My white wine tasted like watered down wine mixed with vinegar, a real
treat! Hands down the worst wine I've had, whether of the boxed or unboxed variety.
On the bright side, the dumplings and Chicken Kiev were good, and we also tried these bizarre
berry dumpling shooters:

I really did not care for the mix of warm dumpling and alcohol though...

In closing, Kiev is really a beautiful city, with lots of greenery and beautiful
churches. It was really a much nicer stopover than either Aaron or I had expected.
It has a nice old-time European feel without much of a Soviet vibe, while still
being quite affordable. Up next: Kazakhstan!

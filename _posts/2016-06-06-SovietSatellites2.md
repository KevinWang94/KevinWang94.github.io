### Intro

Our first country was Ukraine, recently of interest because of its
[conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation)
with Russia in the Crimea, as well as the
[2014 Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Ukrainian_revolution)
which toppled its president. Thankfully, the capital ciy of Kiev is now completely
safe, and where we visited.

### First Night in Kiev

After arriving on an uneventful (albeit cramped) flight from NYC, we checked
into our hostel and wandered around the city. In particular, we saw the
Independence Square where the 2014 Revolution occurred. Of course, the area
now seems largely a commercial shopping center, complete with a McDonald's
at which I ate a "Seasoned American Burger." It was actually quite good,
crunchy tomato & lettuce, BBQ sauce, and higher quality beef than in the US!

While we were at the square, there was also a funeral procession of some
kind by the nationalist [Right Sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Sector).
We weren't quite able to figure
out what was going on, but evidently the deceased was important given the
reverence displayed by the attendees:

Those attendees included this wonderful young gentleman with a fabulous
shirt, "No Knife, No Life!" During the thirty minutes that we observed
the events, he seemed to just mill around the crowd, but never lost
his blank facial expression:

### Chernobyl Day!

This was the exciting day, a day trip to see the Chernobyl area!
It is of course famous for the 1986 nuclear disaster, the worst in human
history.
We went with [](), the most established company running these tours, and
had a wonderful time overall. We got off to an aun auspicious start,
realizing that our tour group consisted of exactly 13 people. 
We set off from Kiev early in the morning, with the ocassional beep
of Geiger counters in the car reminding us of the constant
background radiation that is around us. Along the way, we were shown
various documentaries regarding the events from 1986 and after. In
particular, the botched response by the Soviet authorities to the disaster
which resulted in unnecessary deaths. Unfortunately, I was asleep for most of
the ride. There was even one video demonstrating that a flight from
Toronto to Kiev resulted in more absorbed radiation than our trip to
Chernobyl. I'm no radiation expert, but it appears that radiation increases
significantly at high altitudes. [Here](XX) is a link to some figures
from the tour company highlighting various radiation amounts and rates.
Given that we were going with a government-approved tour group to
sanctioned areas, Aaron and I were not concerned.
Though we had taken the precautions requested by the tour company, wearing
close-toed shoes and long pants and sleeves for the few areas with
elevated radiation. 

After our drive, we arrived at the Exclusion Zone, an XX sized area in which
there are almost no permanent residents save a few stubborn grandpas
and grandmas. There are a sizable number of workers within the zone though,
XXX who apparently make around 1000 Euros per day spent working there.

This begins a series of (retroactive) blog posts about my spring break 2015 trip to the Balkans
with Aaron Roper. As with the Iceland series, the posts are more of a collection of funny stories
and happenings from the trip, and less a true travel journal recounting the details of every city,
church, and square. A lot of the sites have a lot of associated history - I'll try whenever possible
to give a quick summary and then link to the Wikipedia page.

###Introduction

After [Iceland](kevinwang.io/tags/Iceland.html) the year before
we had to go somewhere even more crazy, so we decided
on a whirlwind tour of the Balkans: "7 Countries 7 Days." Specifically, we hit in order:
Bosnia, Croatia, Montenegro, Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia, and Bulgaria. Here's a map of the trip:

And to make it even more fun, we were backpacking! My first time lugging around a heavy backpack...not
the best experience.

###Day 1: Sarajevo

We arrived in Sarajevo and were met by our guide for the day, Skender, from
[Sarajevo Funky Tours](http://www.sarajevofunkytours.com/).
Given the difficulty of getting from the airport to the Tunnel Museum and then into the city, we
decided on brief guided period. Overall, we had a great time with Skender, and would definitely
recommend him to anyone looking for a tour in Sarajevo.

First up was the
[Sarajevo Tunnel Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarajevo_Tunnel)
which is on the site of the tunnel built by the Bosnians to supply the city during the Serbian siege.
It immediately set the theme for the trip, rooted in very recent and tragic history.
Definitely in stark contrast to the previous year's trip to Iceland, which was about carefree nature.
Here, and all over the Balkans, you can still see bullet holes from the conflict and signs about mines:

We then got an unexpected extension to our tour: a drive around the mountains around the city,
which really made us feel back in Iceland - it was unfortunately just as cold and snowy! At one point,
Aaron almost fell down the side of the snowy mountain while taking a picture up on an outcropping.
We also got to see the super cool
[Sarajevo Bobsleigh Track](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pn88syrtsc42nhe/P3130009.JPG?dl=0)
which was originally built for the 1984 Winter Olympics and then abandoned, though that Wikipedia
page says it's being renovated for an upcoming event. Hopefully this gives a sense of the general
cold and snow.

As we drove around, we were continuously crossing the confusing frontline of the war, which now
is the twisty border between the two major political entities within Bosnia & Herzegovina. And we
stopped by an old cemetary where our guide's father, uncle, and grandfather all fought during the war.
As cliche as it sounds, Skender's personal stories about receiving rations during the siege, and
his relatives fighting, really made the history real.

Satisfying my inner European history nerd, we also stopped by the bridge where Archduke Franz Ferdinand
was assassinated in 1914 (the event which eventually triggered WWI):

And finally, we got ourselves kicked out of the Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque that evening,
as we didn't realize it wasn't a non-visitor night. We actually entered and sat down for a bit,
only to have a kind and apologetic old man ask us to leave.

We had dinner at a very touristy, but still surprisingly affordable restaurant. We even tried some
local brandy, which I thought was pretty awful but Aaron seemed to like.
We then spent the night at a extremely affordable but rather cold Sarajevo Airbnb.

Other sights visited: Bascarsija (old bazaar), Vijecnica (old city hall), and Vratnik citadel.

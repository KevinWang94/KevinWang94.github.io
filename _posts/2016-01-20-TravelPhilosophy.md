I often get asked why I travel to the places I do: the Balkans, North Korea,
the Stans, etc. I thought it would be fun to explain myself, so maybe I can
convince others (and myself?) that I'm not crazy. 

###Why these countries?

First, I think everyone has a different idea of what they want from vacations.
Many want to escape it all while on a beach sipping cocktails, or think
about nothing as they cruise around the Mediterranean. 
Now I must confess that I've never tried it, but I generally don't care for
beaches, and I think I'm plenty good at lazing around at home. Though maybe
my life just isn't stressful enough for me to understand... But anyway, what
I want right now from an international vacation is an adventure, something
that takes me slightly out of my comfort zone, something that's both engaging
in the moment while also creating wonderful stories to tell after.

Furthermore, I think a lot of these countries are just incredibly interesting
places to be. North Korea is one of the only places in the world that's
still largely untouched by Coca Cola and McDonald's. The Balkans are one of
the few safe places in the world where you can see the remnants of a very
recent and bloody war.

And sure, these places don't loom quite as large in the history of the West.
But that has its own advantages. Before going to the Balkans,
I knew almost nothing about the area. Taking the trip was a chance for me to
read up on what was a very interesting, albeit often tragic, region and history.
In contrast, visiting Paris was less novel in that I was mostly seeing
and experiencing landmarks, artworks, palaces, etc. that I already knew about
before deciding to go on the trip. And that's definitely not a bad thing. A
lot of places like this are at the top of my travel list, and Versailles
was my favorite place in France precisely because I knew so much about it from
AP Euro. But these countries off the beaten path are often no less
interesting, and planning a trip there can be a chance to learn about a
beautiful history that just happens to be neglected by American history texts.

Finally, traveling to these places can often be a better experience just
because they're off the beaten path. You're less likely to be competing with
thousands of other people at any particular museum or attraction (I hate
crowds!). And you're more likely to see something closer to authentic local
life. Again, I try not to have illusions here - I know that just walking
around a country and snapping pictures can't really give you a sense of the
local culture and people. But, in places with a less developed tourist
industry, it's much easier to at least get glimpses of local life
when your experiences are so constructed. For example, it's much easier
in these places to share buses and restaurants with locals, as there
just aren't enough tourists to sustain tourist trap-esque establishments.

###Is it worth the risk?

Now the less fun part. I'm not in denial - these places are totally risky.
I realize that I could be detained by the DPRK for any number of frivolous
reasons, or kidnapped while in Kazakhstan. But I think these risks are
not quite as high as one might think relative to more conventional destinations.
I believe that people underestimate the risks of traveling to supposedly
safe Western nations. Precisely because they are tourist traps, these
destinations can be a target for thieves, scam artists, and even terrorists.
As I write this, there is a "high threat from terrorism" in France.
And second, these obscure countries are often quite safe. In many cases, they
are unfamiliar to Westerners, which breeds a certain fear. But in
all honesty, I felt perfectly safe in the Balkans, for example. And for
the DPRK (and hopefully the Stans), I'll be on a totally escorted tour,
increasing the safety.

At the end of the day, everyone tries to rationally evaluate the risks involved
and decides whether they're comfortable with them. In my case, an escorted
tour to the DPRK is on the safe side of the line I've drawn, whereas
hitchiking across Afghanistan is not (Google this - people have done it!).

And it is actually because of these risks that I'm preferring to go now. As a young
man in my 20s, I feel much more comfortable taking on these places
than I would as a 50 year old, possibly with kids. Given that I want to
someday go to these places, now is definitely the time to do it. Places
like London and Rome are largely accessible regardless of one's tolerance
for adventure or risk, but Iran most certainly is not.

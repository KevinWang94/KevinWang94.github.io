### Day 3: To the Island!

The day we'd been waiting for, onto Easter Island! Unsurprisingly, the flight was rather
long, X hours, which I passed through some combination of sleeping and watching
Wonder Woman. Be warned that these flights are unfortunately expensive, given the flight's
duration and lack of competition in this market (only LATAM flies the route). We paid
over $700 roundtrip, despite bookly decently early. For aviation geeks, Easter Island
is also notable because there can only be a single inbound flight at any given time
in the air (see [here](http://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/2016/05/12/easter-island-flying-restrictions/)
for more details).

Upon arrival, we paid the national park entrance free, and 
were greeted by someone from our hostel with a traditional lei, who nicely
gave us a small tour of the island's one "city," [Hanga Roa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanga_Roa).
It's a bustling metropolis of 3000 people...the tour did not take long. It was also a bit challenging
as his English was extremely rudimentary. Again, I found this quite surprising. Of all people, you would
think that a hostel employee in an 
[extremely heavily touristed area](http://www.businessinsider.com/tourists-are-ruining-the-easter-island-head-statues-2016-4)
would speak at least passable English.

After settling in at the hostel, we walked down the main strip hoping to arrange a rental car,
and perhaps a tour for our first day on the island. Provided you're able to drive stick shift,
rental cars on the island are extremely plentiful. In addition to two main rental agencies, basically
every single business seems to also rent out the one or two cars that their owners possess.
Unfortunately, neither of us are able to drive stick shift, so we ended up with a rather expensive
[Suzuki Grand Nomade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_Vitara)
from one of big rental agencies. Note that there's no car insurance on the island, but luckily
our Visa credit card benefit came in handy (the same one that paid for the disastrous Iceland
car debacle). We also arranged for a tour for the next day which would hopefully
give us a useful overview and history of the island.

We then embarked on a hike of 
[Rano Kau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rano_Kau), 
one of the three volcanic eruptions that formed Easter island.
It was more of a real hike than we'd anticipated, but we did manage to make it up to the crater:

Which was quite beautiful. We then had just enough time for dinner before catching the sunset. 
As I mentioned, Easter Island can be very expensive, so eating it is a tricky affair. 
But we'd vowed to only have peanut butter once a day, so we walked around in search of a reasonably priced restaurant. 
We ended up at a simple-looking place on the main street, where we each ordered an empanada as well
as a seafood entree. Our waitress seemed a bit perplexe by our order, but her English was only slightly
better than our non-existant Spanish so we weren't sure why. It became clear when the empanadas showed
up. We'd expected a small appetizer-sized portion, but instead it was basically massive enough
to be a meal by itself, densely filled with (in my case) tuna, tomatoes, and onions. This is definitely
a steal if you're trying to eat for cheap on the island:

We ended
[Ahu Tahai](XX)

one of the most popular places to watch the sun set.
An [*ahu*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island#Stone_platforms)
is one of the stone platforms on which the statues were placed.
[Ahu Tahai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahu_Tahai) has five moai, and makes for
a great sunset, as it's on the West side of the island:

### Day 4: Easter Island

We booked a tour for this day, as it was about the same price as a car rental,
but included lunch as well as an English guide. While I don't regret it, in hindsight
I'm not sure how much value it added over just wandering around the island yourself.
If you're able to get a cheaper car rental, or have a group of more than two people,
I'd probably suggest skipping. 

We started the day off at
[Rano Raraku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rano_Raraku), the quarry where the moai
were carved out of the rock. There are also a large number of moai on the outskirts 
of the quarry that are partially buried in the dirt. Our guide explained that these
were unsatisfactory in some way, so they weren't transported to ahus, and didn't have
proper hollowed out eyes. They do however, make for some great photos:

There are even some moai that seem to have fallen/broken during transport:

Seeing the moai in various states of "construction" really drives home
just how much energy was expended in carving these things out of the rock, not to mention
the immense transportation costs (they average 20 tons). It looks like estimates wildly vary, but some
scholars have claimed that the largest moai took a teams of six over a year to finish.
It was also here at the quarry that we saw the National Geographic around-the-world tour
for the first time. They really were incredibly organized, each small group all wearing nametags
and matching backpacks, listening to their mic'd guide explain the history. But for eighty grand,
I guess you'd expect nothing less.

The next stop was
[Ahu Tongariki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahu_Tongariki)
the largest ahu on the island, with 15 moai. This was the most impressive sight on the island
in my opinion:

We even took one cheesy tourist photo!

We then made our way to the
[Navel of the world](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-navel-of-the-world),
a smooth stone believed to have some sort of magical powers. It was...a smooth stone:

Our final stop on the tour was 
[Anakena Beach](https://imaginaisladepascua.com/en/easter-island-sightseeing/easter-island-beaches/anakena/)
on the north side of the island. It's said to be where King Hotu Matu'a first landed upon 
his arrival on the island. We relaxed here for about an hour, dipping our toes into the ocean. 
This is also where
[Ahu Nau Nau](https://imaginaisladepascua.com/en/easter-island-sightseeing/easter-island-archaeology/ahu-nau-nau/).
is, notable because of moai's red [pukaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pukao). Not satisfied with creating
these immense stone rocks, the Rapa Nui people also carved these hats/top-knots out of a red rock
and placed them on top of the statues:

Check-out, back to Chile, the worst experience w/ Uber in my life.

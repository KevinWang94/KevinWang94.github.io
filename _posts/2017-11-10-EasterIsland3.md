### Day 3: To the Island!

The day we'd been waiting for, onto Easter Island! Unsurprisingly, the flight is rather
long, X hours, which I passed through some combination of sleeping and watching
Wonder Woman. Be warned that these flights are unfortunately expensive, given the flight's
duration and lack of competition in this market (only LATAM flies the route). We paid
over $700 roundtrip, despite bookly decently early. For aviation geeks, Easter Island
is also notable because there can only be a single inbound flight at any given time
in the air (see (here)[http://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/2016/05/12/easter-island-flying-restrictions/]
for more details).

Upon arrival, we were greeted by someone from our hostel with a traditional lei, who nicely
gave us a small tour of the island's one "city," [Hanga Roa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanga_Roa).
It's a bustling metropolis of 3000 people...the tour did not take long. It was also a bit challenging
as his English was extremely rudimentary. Again, I found this quite surprising. Of all people, you would
think that a hostel employee in an 
[extremely heavily touristed area](http://www.businessinsider.com/tourists-are-ruining-the-easter-island-head-statues-2016-4)
would speak at least passable English.

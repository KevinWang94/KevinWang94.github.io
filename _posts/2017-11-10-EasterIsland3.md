### Day 3: To the Island!

The day we'd been waiting for, onto Easter Island! Unsurprisingly, the flight was rather
long, X hours, which I passed through some combination of sleeping and watching
Wonder Woman. Be warned that these flights are unfortunately expensive, given the flight's
duration and lack of competition in this market (only LATAM flies the route). We paid
over $700 roundtrip, despite bookly decently early. For aviation geeks, Easter Island
is also notable because there can only be a single inbound flight at any given time
in the air (see (here)[http://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/2016/05/12/easter-island-flying-restrictions/]
for more details).

Upon arrival, we were greeted by someone from our hostel with a traditional lei, who nicely
gave us a small tour of the island's one "city," [Hanga Roa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanga_Roa).
It's a bustling metropolis of 3000 people...the tour did not take long. It was also a bit challenging
as his English was extremely rudimentary. Again, I found this quite surprising. Of all people, you would
think that a hostel employee in an 
[extremely heavily touristed area](http://www.businessinsider.com/tourists-are-ruining-the-easter-island-head-statues-2016-4)
would speak at least passable English.

After settling in at the hostel, we walked down the main strip hoping to arrange a rental car,
and perhaps a tour for our two full days on the island. Provided you're able to drive stick shift,
rental cars on the island are extremely plentiful. In addition to two main rental agencies, basically
every single business seems to also rent out the one or two cars that their owners possess.
Unfortunately, neither of us are able to drive stick shift, so we ended up with a rather expensive

from one of big rental agencies. We also arranged for a tour for the next day which would hopefully
give us a useful overview and history of the island.

We then embarked on a hike of xx, one of the three volcanic eruptions that formed Easter island.
It was more of a real hike than we'd anticipated, but we did manage to make it up to the crater:

Which was quite beautiful. 

We then had just enough time for dinner before catching the sunset. As I mentioned, Easter Island
can be very expensive, so eating it is a tricky affair. But we'd vowed to only have peanut butter
once a day, so we walked around in search of a reasonably priced restaurant.

### Camel Trekking in the Sahara

We then mounted our camels! They were all tied together, and we basically hopped on
one at a time, as the camel was coaxed upward soon after. It was generally much more stable
than I expected, as there was this metal frame that we could hold onto. I held it pretty
tight the whole time just in case, but aside from a couple rocky down-dune parts, that
wasn't necessary. I will say that riding the camels was supremely uncomfortable. I'm not
sure if it's because I didn't find the rhythm or sitting position or what, but I was pretty sore
the next couple of days. Here's a picture of me on the camel, bundled up to as to minimize
the sand blowing onto my face:

The journey to our camp took a bit more than an hour, at a pretty slow pace. The men
leading the camels were riding instead of walking over the dunes, so that should give
you an idea of our pace. Given the discomfort, I was pretty excited when I saw the
first camp peeking over the dunes, especially as it seemed so nice, with a red carpet
outside and everything! But nope, that wasn't ours. We had one more false start like
this, which was especially sad because it had for some crazy reason started to rain!
And then, the rain even briefly turned to hail. I'm not sure what weather God I offended,
but it was quite the experience. We asked the guys at the camp that night how often it
rains there, and we were told basically never. So I guess we got a unique experience.
After all, how many people can say they were hailed on while riding camelback through the
Sahara!

We finally did make it to our camp, which looked altogether shabbier than those
we had passed, but I didn't really mind. Given the price we had paid, I wasn't expecting
luxury or anything:

We dismounted in a flattened our part, here's me soon after doing so:

Those black spots that are all over the sand would of course be camel droppings.

Camp was basic to say the least, each tent was basically a frame covered on all
sides with thick camel blankets (note: not waterproof). In ours there were
six beds arranged one next to another, with almost no space in between. I felt
relatively lucky, as we heard from some other folks there that either someone had
taken their bedding before they went to sleep, or there just wasn't a bed for them
(a group of Chinese tourists seemed to have slept sitting at the tables in the main tent).

### Into the Desert: The Atlas Mountains

We were met at the delightfully early time of 7:30AM for our tour, and piled
into a minibus of sorts joined by five Spanish-speaking girls who seemed way too
amped up for 7 in the morning. They proceeded to almost immediately give our
driver some white pill...so perhaps that had something to do with it... After a
couple minutes, we pulled over at the side of the road and were told to move to
a more legit-looking tour bus which sat around 15 people. Evidently our first
vehicle was only for transporting us from the hostel to here. We and the Spanish
girls were also sadly heading to separate tours, though I can't say I was too
torn-up about that. And the people on our actual tour were really wonderful,
more about them later.

To be honest, the various stops we made along the way to the desert were not
super remarkable, and given my general state of exhaustion over the next couple
of days, my memory of them is a bit hazy. I'll try to describe the highlights
here though. We first drove out of Marrakech into the High Atlas mountains,
and then to
[Ait Benhaddou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%AFt_Benhaddou),
a UNESCO World Heritage Site with a still-standing straw-clay old city from the
days of the Saharan caravan route to Marrakech. It's also weirdly where a bunch
of movies like Gladiator as well as scenes from Game of Thrones. Here's a fake
gate that was built for one of the movies there (I sadly don't remember which):

And an actual shot of the town:

At some we stopped for lunch at place that was obviously kept in business by
tour companies, which we suspect were given kickbacks for stopping there.
The meals were about $10, which isn't a lot by US standards, but was two or three
times even the price of simple places right on the main square in Marrakech.
Certainly the money wasn't being spent on the food, as this was by far the worst
meal I had in my entire time in Morocco. Purportedly a "vegetable tangine," it
was basically steamed vegetables over a watery soup with hints of flavor.

We ended the day in the Dades Valley, I think in the city of Skoura, though I'm
not completely sure. I was a bit apprehensive about the hotel, as we saw some
scary reviews on Tripadvisor about bugs, lack of heat or hot water, etc. But
it was actually really nice with clean beds, heat, and hot water! Apparently
the King of Morocco had actually stayed at the resort some years ago.

#### Cool People

Dinner was at the hotel, where we had a wide-ranging conversation about
everything from past trips to drug legalization to XX. One advantage I didn't
mention in my post about
[travel philosophy](XX)
is how cool most of the people who are visiting these slightly-more-interesting
places are. Just on our bus there was:
+ A Japanese man, who despite speaking only Japanese and extremely broken
  English, was on a three month around-the-world journey: Japan -> NYC ->
  several South American countries -> Europe -> Morocco -> Cairo -> Namibia ->
  Japan (I'm sure I've forgotten some).
+ A Spanish woman and Irish man who had met, lived in Paris for awhile, traveled
  for a year around the world, and were now continuing their travels while based
  in Ireland.
+ A young man from Germany who had worked odd jobs in Australia for a year while 
  making his way around the island.
+ A couple from Mexico who, after leaving Morocco, were going to walk the 
  [Camino de Santiago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago)
  for several weeks. Not for any religious reason, but for the adventure.
  An older German lady on the tour had also done it before.

There was even a disco...

### Days 2 + 3: Into the Desert

We were met at the delightfully early time of 7:30AM for our tour, and piled into a
minibus of sorts joined by five Spanish-speaking girls who seemed way too amped up for 7
in the morning. They proceeded to almost immediately give our driver some white pill...so
perhaps that had something to do with it. After a couple minutes, we pulled over at the
side of the road and were told to move to a more legit-looking tour bus which sat around
15 people. Evidently our first vehicle was only for transporting us from the hostel to
here. We and the Spanish girls were also sadly heading to separate tours, though I can't
say I was too torn-up about that. And the people on our actual tour were really wonderful,
more about them later. This general confusion about what was happening stuck around for
the next couple days, as most of us on the tour only had a tenuous memory of the
itinerary.

To be honest, the various stops we made along the way to the desert were not super
remarkable, and given my general state of exhaustion over the next couple of days, my
memory of them is a bit hazy. I'll try to describe the highlights here though. We first
drove out of Marrakech into the High Atlas mountains, and then to
[Ait Benhaddou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%AFt_Benhaddou),
a UNESCO World Heritage Site with a still-standing straw-clay old city from the
days of the Saharan caravan route to Marrakech. It's also weirdly where a bunch
of movies like Gladiator as well as scenes from Game of Thrones. Here's a fake
gate that was built for one of the movies there (I sadly don't remember which):

And an actual shot of the town:

In the afternon, we stopped for lunch at place that was obviously kept in business by
tour companies, which we suspect were given kickbacks for stopping there.
The meals were about $10, which though not a lot by US standards, was still two or three
times even the price of simple places right on the main square in Marrakech.
Certainly the money wasn't being spent on the food, as this was by far the worst
meal I had in my entire time in Morocco. Purportedly a "vegetable 
[tangine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajine)," it
was basically steamed vegetables over a watery soup with hints of flavor.

We ended the day in the Dades Valley, I think in the city of Skoura.  I was a bit
apprehensive about the hotel, as we saw some scary reviews on Tripadvisor about bugs, lack
of heat or hot water, etc. But it was actually really nice with clean beds, heat, and hot
water! Apparently the King of Morocco had actually stayed at the resort some years ago.
There was even a disco club or something that some folks checked out after dinner. 
Apparently it wasn't that great, few people, some creepy drunk locals, and unnecessarily
loud music.

#### Cool People

Dinner was at the hotel, where we had a wide-ranging conversation about
everything from past trips to drug legalization to XX. One advantage I didn't
mention in my post about
[travel philosophy](XX)
is how cool most of the people who are visiting these slightly-more-interesting
places are. Just on our bus there was:
+ A Japanese man, who despite speaking only Japanese and extremely broken
  English, was on a three month around-the-world journey: Japan -> NYC ->
  several South American countries -> Europe -> Morocco -> Cairo -> Namibia ->
  Japan (I'm sure I've forgotten some).
+ A Spanish woman and Irish man who had met, lived in Paris for awhile, traveled
  for a year around the world, and were now continuing their travels while based
  in Ireland.
+ A young man from Germany who had worked odd jobs in Australia for a year while 
  making his way around the island.
+ A couple from Mexico who, after leaving Morocco, were going to walk the 
  [Camino de Santiago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago)
  for several weeks. Not for any religious reason, but for the adventure.
  An older German lady on the tour had also done it before.

#### Day 3: Gorges and Carpets

Sadly, the time difference had finally gotten to me, and I just couldn't sleep the evening
in the hotel, probably due to too much napping on the bus. I instead started reading
[Ready Player One](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969571-ready-player-one) and ended
up just finishing the book. This was perhaps unwise, but it was really good!  And once I
got about halfway through, I decided to just give up on sleep and finish.  Would
enthusiastically recommend. Anyway, I was not in the best shape in the morning, but
thankfully there was plenty of time to sleep on the bus before our arrival at the
[Dades Gorges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dad%C3%A8s_Gorges)
which, while beautiful, were basically a less-compelling version of the
[Zion Narrows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Narrows_(Zion_National_Park))

Again, my memory isn't perfect for this day, but I believe we then ended up at a "carpet
cooperative" where we were pitched carpets from a cooperative of nomadic women. The whole
presentation was a bit odd, with a woman behind a loom in one corner of the room. She
would do various things as the (male) presenter mentioned them, but otherwise just sort of
sat there.  It somehow felt like she was a zoo animal or something, definitely
awkward. The presenter himself was quite the personality. He kept saying funny things like
"happy wife happy life" to emphasize his friendliness I guess? And also he claimed that
he, unlike those untrustworthy salesmen in Marrakech, was selling us good quality carpets
for a good price in a non-pushy manner. Unfortunately, his repeated insistence sort of
undercut that message. Here's him on the left:

As part of the presentation, we also learned that the Moroccan government apparently had
provided these previously nomaid peoples with some sort of help such that they could now
live in the village where they had access to public services like schools and
hospitals. But, some of the families still chose to live in the traditional manner for
something like half the year.

From here, it was a straight shot to Merzouga, the jumping off point for the camel
trekking experience, which will be the subject of the next post!

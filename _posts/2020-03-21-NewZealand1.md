It's again been a while, but I'm back with another set of posts, this time about a week-long trip to New Zealand, with
24 hours in Australia (Sydney) at the end. I know, I know, it's a rather "mainstream" destination for this blog. I originally
wasn't even planning to write these posts. But yesterday was my last day in the office / today officially
begins my working-from-home Coronavirus isolation,
and this seems like a marginally healthier use of time than binging Netflix. Also, my normal pleasurable time-waster of
planning future travel was starting to get a bit depressing given how far in the future that travel has to be. So, here
we are. I hope everyone is staying relatively sane in these trying times, and of course washing their hands and not
touching their face. 

This first post discusses a bunch of random background for the trip. Feel free to just skip to the next one where
the actual travel fun begins.

### Background

New Zealand and Australia have always been relatively high on my travel list. And after visiting [South America]({{ "/tags/easterisland.html" | prepand: site.baseurl}}),
Oceania would be my last "normal" continent (only short Antarctica). But the long flights required to get
there (20+ hours, with a required connection) have always been a damper. Air New Zealand actually revealed plans last
year to begin
[non-stop service](https://www.airnewzealand.com/press-release-2019-start-spreading-news-airnz-reveals-auckland-new-york-flight-details)
to New York. And Qantas was pushing forward with "Project Sunrise", asking Boeing and Airbus to design planes that could
make the flight from e.g. Sydney to New York non-stop. But it looks like those plans may be
[on hold](https://simpleflying.com/coronavirus-qantas-project-sunrise/) due to recent events. Of course, even these flights
would mean 35+ hours of flying for a one week vacation. So, I instead came up with what I thought was the perfect solution by tacking
this onto a work trip. 
I booked a OneWorld ["Round-the-World"](https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-tips/buying-a-rtw-ticket/) itinerary, visiting
New Zealand and Australia before stops for work in our Hong Kong and London offices. And the itinerary was intentionally designed to
fly West the whole time, making time difference adjustments easy! I was originally planning to make the trip with Michal and Zander, two
friends/coworkers from our London and NYC offices, respectively. You might remember Michal as the youthful
[snowball-throwing]({{"/travel/2019/07/02/Svalbard4.html" | prepend: site.baseurl}})
member of our Svalbard travel party.

### Coronavirus

Unfortunately, the Coronavirus situation began in earnest a month or two before my intended travel date (I was to leave NYC on
February 21st). We continued monitoring the situation, and as of late February, it seemed like things were still relatively
stable world wide. Obviously, hindsight is 20/20, but at the time I boarded my flight, the situation seemed much more confined
to Mainland China, with even Hong Kong having the situation relatively under control. And of course my general prior is that
people's fear of travel is overblown. Probably I should've distinguished fear of e.g. traveling to Iran with fear of travel
during a burgeoning health crisis, but alas. However, the prudent and prescient Zander decided
to cancel his trip, leaving just Michal and me. Michal in fact left London two weeks before I left NYC, spending a week in SE Asia
and then one week in our HKG office.

We received yet another ominous sign when the
[multi-day hike](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/fiordland/places/fiordland-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/routeburn-track/)
we intended to go on was closed for the remainder of the season by
[devastating storms](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12306586) on New Zealand's South Island.
Thankfully no one was hurt, but many had to be choppered off of the trail, and a landslide plowed into a hiker hut that we
would have been staying at just a couple weeks later:

A bit of a bummer as I had been excited to do my first multi-day hike, and even let Michal convince me to do it "authentically,"
instead of going the [luxury route](https://www.ultimatehikes.co.nz/multi-day-guided-walks/routeburn-track/).
Thankfully, we hadn't done much booking of things, so we just pushed our flight from the North to South Island (AKL -> ZQN) by a day, and planned
instead to hike the [Tongariro Alpine Crossing](https://www.earthtrekkers.com/tongariro-alpine-crossing/), supposedly the best
day hike in the world. This is definitely the least I've ever planned a trip - we booked multiple accomodations in NZ from the
car on the afternoon of our arrival.

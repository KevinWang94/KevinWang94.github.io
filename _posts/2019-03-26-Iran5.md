### Day 7: Arrival in Shiraz

We arrived in Shiraz in the evening, with just enough time to wander around a bit. Highlights included this bookstore that bizarrely had Dr. Phil works:

as well as bodybuilding magazines?

Also, I think I make for a beautiful Persian princess, don't you agree?

### Day 8: Shiraz Sightseeing

In my opinion, Shiraz was definitely the most beautiful of Iran's cities. Even the bus stops have stained glass!

Perhaps unsurprisingly, it's also the city where we saw the most tourists, and especially in large tour groups. It seemed like French groups were the most common, followed by Spanish. 

Q was also from Shiraz, so he got to spend our time in the city at home with "the boss," his term for his wife. While we visited the city, he lamented the loss of three things that Shiraz was historically known for: great wine, poets, and women... 

#### Nasir-ol-molk Mosque

The day began at perhaps this mosque, perhaps the [most famous sight in Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir-ol-molk_Mosque). It's certainly the most Instagram-worthy, as the morning light shines through the staind glass, creating colored dappled patterns on the carpeted ground. Here's one of the better pictures I took:

Note the woman posing in the background, who I think may have actually been an travel Instagrammer given her perfect posing and the care lavished on the photos. In my opinion, the place does live up to the hype, though take care to not visit at the same time as a tour bus, which showed up half way through our time there. This was one of the only places where it felt like everyone was crowding around to get the same photo, because the inside area is quite small, and the light was coming and going through the clouds.

#### Zinat Al-Molk House

This was another older house with a garden, that I would've glossed over for the blog were it not for the most beautful "you are being watched!" signs I have ever seen:

#### MashDonald's!

People may be aware that I have an unhealthy obsession with McDonald's, and try to eat at one in every country I visit. This means that I've probably eaten at one in over 35 countries, a real traveler's badge of honor. Unfortunately, while an Iranian McDonald's used to exist in the 1970s, it 
[closed in 1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_McDonald%27s_restaurants#Former_locations) due to local political events. Fortunately, in the vein of Freshway and ZFC, there is a local knock-off, MashDonald's. 
I looked it up ahead of time, and made sure to ask both our tour company and tour guide about taking us there. Q was nice enough to drive me to the location, but unfortunately it was closed! A true low point of the trip. At least I got this photo of the logo...

#### Other Sights

We also saw the Tomb of Hafez (largely another garden, dedicated to one of Iran's most famous poets), the Zinat Al-

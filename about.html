## About

I originally hail from South Burlington, VT and am currently a senior at
Harvard College studying computer science with a minor in government.
After graduation, I will be working as a software developer at
[Jane Street Capital](https://www.janestreet.com/). Amongst other things,
I'm interested in politics, functional programming, traveling, and horology.

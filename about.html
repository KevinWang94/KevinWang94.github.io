## About

I originally hail from South Burlington, VT and am currently a software
developer at [Jane Street Capital](https://www.janestreet.com/).
Before starting at Jane Street, I studied computer science with a minor in
government at Harvard College.
Amongst other things,
I'm interested in politics, functional programming, and traveling to the world's craziest places.

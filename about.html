## About

I originally hail from South Burlington, VT and am currently a senior at Harvard College studying
computer science with a minor in government.
After graduation, I will be working as a software developer at [Jane Street Capital](https://www.janestreet.com/). Amongst other things, I'm interested in politics, traveling, and horology.
